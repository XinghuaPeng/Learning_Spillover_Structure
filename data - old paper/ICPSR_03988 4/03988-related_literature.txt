The authors explain that their study relied heavily on the well-established
method used by Wolfgang, et al. of sampling a portion of the U.S.
population and asking them to respond to a series of crime vignettes. The
goal of such a method is to gauge public perception of the seriousness of
different crimes. In this case, however, the authors used a constrained-
choice model designed to force the respondent to first choose which of a
series of crimes is more serious, and second, how much they would be
willing to pay to reduce crime in their community. Other important aspects
of this study included: (1) the focus on crimes normally encountered by
local criminal justice agencies; (2) the focus on the parole decision in a
constrained-choice model; and (3) the incorporation of explicit tradeoffs
of various crimes and sentences to better gauge public preferences. The
authors also employed two new methodologies designed to gain information on
the publicâs willingness to pay for crime prevention and control
policies. A nationally representative survey of 1,300 U.S. adults found
that, with two exceptions, the public largely agreed with current
sentencing decisions concerning incarceration and length of sentence. The
authors found strong support for spending more money to further reduce
crimes, although most preferred that the money go toward prevention
programs and more police officers rather than more prisons. Finally, the
authors elicited information about willingness to pay for crime reduction
and found that most respondents were willing to pay between $75 and $150
per year for prevention programs that would reduce local crime rates by 10
percent. In conclusion, the authors note that this study is relevant for
policymakers who use seriousness-of-crime surveys to decide current
criminal justice and police policies.

It is important for policymakers to understand how the public views the
appropriateness of current criminal justice policy, especially concerning
the appropriateness of incarceration, length of sentence, and parole
decisions. This research project tested new methodologies designed to
elicit information about the publicâs preferences regarding sentencing
and parole of criminal offenders. The authors explained that their study
relies heavily on the well-established method used by Wolfgang, et al. of
sampling a portion of the U.S. population and asking them to respond to a
series of crime vignettes. The goal of such a method is to gauge public
perception of the seriousness of different crimes. In this case, however,
the authors used a constrained-choice model designed to force the
respondent to first, choose which of a series of crimes is more serious,
and second, how much they would be willing to pay to reduce crime in their
community. Other important aspects of this study included: (1) the focus on
