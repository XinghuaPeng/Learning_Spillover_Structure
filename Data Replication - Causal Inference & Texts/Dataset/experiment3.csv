0,"No victim, no crime. Just send him right back and move on.","No"
1,"just based on my gut feeling this is how i feel.  I feel he should not be sent to prison .  Actions should be avoided for the time being.","No"
1,"They should send him to prison to serve time for his crimes.  After that they need to deport him back to his country.","Yes"
0,"This person illegally entered the country. He doesn't belong here. He should be arrested and deported.","Yes"
1,"He has a prior history. This guy could be a harm to someone if he's not locked up.","Yes"
0,"He is not a violent offender. Check to see his reasons for coming to the US and if he just has an expired visa, etc, and get him on the right track.","No"
0,"I don't think people should be imprisoned for simple illegal immigration. He may be a refugee or similar. He should be interviewed (to determine if there is a potential for refugee status) and then sent back to his home country if there's no potential.","No"
0,"It's a waste of resources to house a man in prison. The U.S. government should just deport him.","No"
0,"To clarify on my decision on whether or not I think this person should be sent to prison, I think he should, just in his own country so we don't have to foot the bill with our tax payer money. They should deport him to where he came from and serve prison time there, or we fine that country or something, I don't know.","Yes"
0,"I don't think trying to immigrate should be a criminal offense. That's not a criminal to me. A criminal is someone who I wouldn't feel safe around, who needs to be locked up to protect the rest of us. The path to citizenship is already difficult enough. ","No"
1,"He's in the country illegally. He also has a history of crime, including violent crime.","Yes"
0,"I do not think the man should be sent to prison because that would be wasting US funds. The US government should expel him back to his country.","No"
1,"This person should be sent back. He has previously been deported and continues to disobey the laws of the country","Yes"
1,"They should offer assistance to help this man legally be in this country. Then from there maybe put him on probation to ensure he does not commit any more crimes.","No"
1,"He must be deported to his home country of citizenship and not permitted to reenter the US.","No"
0,"I think that unless the person committed some kind of serious crime, there's no reason for them to be put in jail. He doesn't have a previous criminal record, so I don't see a problem with this person being in the US, regardless of how he entered. ","No"
1,"He should be deported upon completion of his prison term","Yes"
0,"Since he had been arrested before, he is guilty of a crime. Since he is guilty of a crime, I think he should be arrested and deported back to his country. ","Yes"
0,"Not being in the country legally is reason to deport someone, not imprison them. Not every crime warrants imprisonment, plus they're not even a citizen. ","No"
0,"It was her first incident and there were special circumstances","No"
0,"At the very worst, the offender should be returned to his home country. I think a more appropriate punishment would be some kind of immigration penalty - for example, he cannot apply for citizenship in the US for +1 year. Immigrants often immigrate to the United States because they have a very real need to do so, and they should not be punished harshly for this need. ","No"
0,"More information is needed in order to determine why this man entered the United States legally. Was he facing convictions in his own country? I think that the U.S. government should look into this person's circumstances and background further before making a determination.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"SInce he was convicted of a crime in the US, there should be jail time.  He should also be deported once his sentence is served, because of his convictions.","No"
0,"Because I don't think going to prison helps anyone in this situation.Since illegal immigration is illegal in itself he should be deported. They should heavily document this person to make sure they can identify them in the future.","No"
0,"He should be given the opportunity to become a citizen, or he should be returned to his home country.  I do not think prison is the answer.  A lot of immigrants come for a better life and opportunity for their family.  Not because they have ill intentions or are criminals.","No"
0,"This man has never had a prior offense, and his only crime is trying to live in the United States. If they let him live here, he wouldn't have committed any crimes, and could go on to be a positive member of society.","No"
1,"As long as he's being sent to prison in his home country, then yes. I don't agree with him being sent to prison here, because it's utilizing resources for someone that doesn't have the right to be here, as he didn't follow proper procedure to get into the country. I am way of his criminal record, but people can change. If he tried to enter the country illegally, I'm assuming he hasn't really -- either way, he should be in prison.","Yes"
0,"Person should be questioned as to why they entered illegally.  Should then be determined if they should stay or be deported after vetting.","No"
1,"The person should be fined and sent to prison. This is not the first offense and deserves to be punished.","Yes"
1,"He should be imprisoned in this country. Wherever he came from obviously can't be trusted to hold him.","Yes"
1,"He should be sent back because of his previous violent crime.  The U. S. government should not take any action with this person.","Yes"
0,"It depends on consequences, I do not have enough information to answer this question. I think police should take more information.. Is there some form of temporary stay in prison? ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"This person is violet and does not follow the law. He came here illegally and he is a bad citizen that endangers other people. He should go to jail.","Yes"
0,"I am unclear why every action one might take must involve a long term in prison.  """"Oh, you crossed out border!  It's prison for you!""""  It's one thing to send someone back where they came from and an entirely different thing to throw them in prison for years for something like this.  """"Land of the free, home of the brave""""... what a bunch of tosh.","No"
1," If he is trying to enter the US from another country illegally, no matter who it is, they should be questioned and detained by authority or deported back. You have no idea what their intentions are, and if they can't legally get a permit to enter the country, they should probably not be here.","Yes"
1,"This person is not a legal immigrant and has been convicted of crimes previously.  I am not in favor of individuals such as this staying in the country.","Yes"
1,"This person should be immediately sent back to his home country. I don't believe U.S. citizens should have to pay for his jail time. Jail in the U.S. can be like a vacation for some foreigners.","No"
1,"I believe that because this person is a violent criminal, he should serve a short prison term then be deported back to his country. If he tries to enter the country again, he should serve an extensive amount of prison time.","Yes"
1,"No lets not spend anymore putting people in prison, send him back to his home country.  We have enough money problems as it is we cant keep locking up people its too expensive.","No"
1,"PErson just should be sent back to their home country","No"
1,"HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND NEEDS TO BE JAILED AS A DETERRENT","Yes"
0,"He should not be sent to prison, our prisons are over populated.  He should be sent back where he came from.","No"
1,"This is a dangerous man, already served 2 prison sentences in his home country, now he's trying to enter our country. He needs to be locked up.","Yes"
1,"Because he was convicted of illegally entering the country AND he had a prior criminal record then he should be imprisoned. He should be sent to prison because he has a prior deportation and a conviction for a serious crime‰Û_ not something like a traffic offense.","Yes"
0,"Why? Most people I know want to leave this shitty country and here you have someone who actually wants to be here. I say give him a work permit and a job.","No"
1,"Yes, he illegally entered the country - But, the taxpayers do not deserve to have to support this fellow.  Send him back.","No"
0,"I think that he should be deported. I think that unless he has a good claim for asylum, he needs to go home to his country. He can't just stay here illegally.","No"
0,"beucase it is his first offense he should be sent back home","No"
0,"He has circumvented the law to gain an advantage and was caught. Therefore, the appropriate measure should be to punish him within the confines of the law. He has already shown that he is willing to break the laws, so in order to make sure he would be deported back to where he came from, he should be imprisoned in the interim. This would also serve as a deterrent for others trying to do the same.","Yes"
1,"Why wouldn't he be? Illegally entering the country is an offense of its own and he has priors, too, even for violent crime. He also was deported.","Yes"
1,"If he is simply deported, he will try to reenter the US.  If there is a harsher consequence, then maybe he will now.","Yes"
1,"This man should be imprisoned because he entered illegally. He has a violent past. After serving his prison sentence, here should be deported again.","Yes"
0,"I believe he was trying to get to a better life. This shouldn't be imprisonment. But he should follow the steps to get himself into a citizenship program in the United States.","No"
0,"He could be a refugee. He could have entered because he was in danger.","No"
0,"28 year old male illegally entering country should not be jailed but held until totally investigated to make sure He is not a terrorist and then sent back to his country. He should be put in a database to make sure it doesn't happen again and then He can try to come into Our country legally to gain citizenship.","No"
1,"I don't think she should be sent to jail.  Everyone makes mistakes an no one was harmed in this event.","No"
0,"I don't think he should go to prison because he does not have a criminal background. I would like to think he has a legitimate reason for entering illegally so we cannot be too harsh in punishing him.","No"
0,"He should be made to return to his own country because he came in illegally.  It's not our responsibility to pay for him in prison","No"
0,"   There is no prior offense. I would guess that the country he is coming from is most likely to be Mexico.  Many of these people who come to the country can take the lowest-paying farm jobs that Americans do not want and that make our produce prices affordable. If he is able to work his way up from there, good for him. This is (should be) a land of opportunity.","No"
0,"I believe the man should be sent back to his country.  I don't want my taxpayer dollars paying for someone who came here illegally.","No"
1,"I don't think he should be imprisoned for simply entering the country illegally, unless he was specifically barred due to past crimes. I think most of our immigration laws are too stringent. Depending on the severity of his past misdeeds, I think he should be given an opportunity to legally become a US citizen; if the crimes were very violent, I think he should be deported, fined, and specifically barred from re-entry.","No"
0,"This person should not go to jail.  They should be deported.","No"
0,"crime is crime. so if someone commits crime, he should be punished","Yes"
1,"This activity indeed broke the law. In fact, this person is actually is dangerous for the society. ","Yes"
0,"The US Gov should deport the man back to his country. He wasn't caught committing any damaging crime, so prison isn't appropriate.","No"
1,"This man is likely a danger to himself or others and should be punished, but I do not think he should be sent to prison in the United States. Instead, I think he should be deported back to his country of origin. Additionally, due to this man's willingness to illegally cross the border, criminal recidivism, and history of violent behavior, he should be barred from entering the United States for at least several years.","No"
1,"they should just deport him to his country if he doesnt have his green card if he does have his green card he should stay here of course and get some jail time, but if he doesnt have his papers he should be deported ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"This person has clearly demonstrated a pattern of violence and criminal activity. Allowing him into the United States would have a negative effect on national security.","Yes"
1,"I wouldn't put him in jail here, but I would send him back to his country so he could spend some more time in jail there. For which reason should we spend money to let him stay and eat in US jails?!","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"no he should not be sent to prison. if he entered the country illegally and has priors the he should be held at an I.C.E. facility. Then deported back to his home country.","No"
1,"Take away drivers lincenes. To prevent her hurting someone .","No"
0,"This is the thing I don't understand about catching illegal immigrants. Why are we putting them in prison? What aren't we just giving them a one-way ticket back to where they came from? I am all for immigrants coming to this country and following proper channels. But why should we spend further money and resources on them by putting them in jail?","No"
1,"He should be placed in jail for the immigration offense.  While this is more expensive than deporting him, it is more effective in preventing future harm as he is likely to reoffend and attempt to re-enter if he is simply deported.  He has already returned to the country after being deported, in willful contempt of immigration law.","Yes"
0,"If the young man entered the country illegally  before he was 18 and this is his only crime, he should be given a lawyer and 1 year to start the process of becoming a legal citizen or deported.  If he came to the country after he was 18 illegally and this is he only crime, he should be sent back to his country of origin.  If this is NOT his first crime and he gets deported, he should be banned from reentering the country legally for 2 years.","No"
0,"I think they should look into why he's here, how long he's been here, any relevant background info. If they deem he could pose a threat i would recommend deporting. The reason why being if hes simply a law abiding citizen i see no issues letting him remain here.","No"
0,"","No"
1,"He has a prior conviction so jail time is needed. He cannot be put back on the street just to commit another crime.","Yes"
1,"I don't know what the standard protocol is for this, but it sounds like he should be deported again, but I'm not sure if you typically serve prison time before that happens. I have no problem with people illegally entering the country, but if you're going to commit several crimes and still continue doing it after being deported once then maybe you should be forced to leave. Also, it's important if he has US citizenship. At this point, it doesn't sound like the person does.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"This is a non-violent crime; he is not a threat to society with no other offenses. The person could rationally and justifiably be deported. The person should have an opportunity to apply for citizenship, though ideally before they've entered illegally in the first place.","No"
1,"It depends on the nature of the violent action from before. Not enough information to decide.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should serve prison time and then be deported. A message should be sent to other potential illegal immigrants that this is what happens. The U.S. can't afford this on any level.","Yes"
1,"I a lot of factors are to be considered when deciding if someone should go to prison or not. Like what were the circumstances of the violent crime, when was he deported before, does he have violent tendencies? It's not fair to the individual to decided their fate on a brief summary. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Because he's not a bad man.  He just wants to have a better life in the U.S.","No"
0,"He should be deported. But, he should not be put in jail. Send him back and do not crowd our prisons even more. ","No"
0,"If this man was convicted of a crime after entering the US illegally, then yes he should go to prison.  However, if he was just entering the US (illegally), just trying to find a better life (which is usually the case), then he should be giving information to acquire US citizenship and then be sent back to his country.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I personally do not believe that she should go to prison this is her first offense.she should be given a harsh probation sentence such as probation, community service and possibly fines but no more than that","No"
0,"It should be on a case by case matter, I need more info. Is he fleeing a war torn country? Let him in. ","No"
1,"I do not believe he should be sent to prison because, assuming he would be sent to a U.S. prison, it would be a burden on the taxpayers and our already overcrowded prison system. I believe the U.S. government should deport the person in question.","No"
0,"I think that first time offenders of illegal border crossings should be given a warning not to return illegally and returned back to the country they are from, or across the border they were caught coming in from.","No"
0,"Most people who come to America do so out of love for their families and to try to make a better life for themselves.  Our prisons should be filled with real criminals, not people who are just trying to make ends meet.","No"
0,"The U.S. Government should look at these type of situations on a case by case basis. Is this man a positive influence in his community? Does he work? Has he ever been convicted of any other crimes? If he is a non violent member of society, he should definitely not be sent to prison and he it should be easier for him to get citizenship so he can pay taxes and contribute like the rest of us.","No"
0,"The male should not be imprisoned, he should be deported. We do not need to be supporting this criminal in our system. The person should be sent back to his country of origin.","No"
1,"American tax dollars shouldn't pay for this man's prison sentence. He should be deported immediately and put in prison in his own country.","No"
1,"We don't want someone who is known to commit a violent crime in our country.  They could come into our country and harm a harmless citizen.  He is also committing a crime by illegally coming into our country.  Doesn't sound like a stand up guy.","Yes"
0,"I think this person should be interviewed by government officials to explain to him the correct process to entry into the United States; as well to find out what drove him to enter the U.S. in a polite manner. If you provide him with guidelines for work visas or a path to seek citizenship, visitor guidelines, the individual will be informed and the U.S. officials could let this occurrence be a warning and learning experience. ","No"
0,"Prison does not make sense. He is not endangering anyone.","No"
0,"There is too much precedent for illegal entry to jail a human being for simply doing so.  If he has never been found worthy of imprisonment before, imprisonment now will solve absolutely nothing and indeed add to the problem.","No"
0,"He seems to be a good person. He is a victim of circumstance.","No"
0,"I think people make mistakes. She has never been in trouble before. She should be arrested but not arrested.","No"
1,"This person has already committed multiple crimes, one of these of a violent nature. I think this time there should be no deportation but he should serve the full sentence for his crime. There is no point in deporting him back to his country and then having him again here trying to enter illegally.","Yes"
1,"I honestly don't know if it's better to put him in prison here in the U.S., which would require our country to spend money on him while he is in prison, or deport him back to his own country again. Deportation might mean he would just come back to the U.S. in the future, but again, imprisonment would mean our country would spend money on his prison stay.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"This person has committed no other crime than entering the US illegally, therefore the punishment should only be up to removing them, no more. There should not be punitive measures for this.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison or deported only because he previously had convictions for violent crimes and was entering the country illegally.  I would think that the US should really just deport him and not allow him back in the country.","Yes"
0,"The US government should work with the individual to determine if he needs to be sent back to the the country he is a citizen of, or if he qualifies to stay in the country by going through an approved process. His background and history should be taken into account, along with his current situation (family, work, education, etc.). ","No"
1,"The man should be deported back to his country. Attempting to enter the country illegally is not something he should go to jail for.","No"
0,"No jail time for sure. Sounds like they just wanted a better life. However, there are laws. Deport back to country of origin.","No"
0,"I don't think that I have sufficient information to make a determination.  If a conviction assumes that he has done something illegal in addition to (or as a result of) his arrival, then probably yes.  But if his only offense was in being here illegally, I would need to understand more about his purpose for being here, other extenuating circumstances, etc.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"It's against the law to enter the country illegally.  Break laws,  go to jail.","Yes"
0,"There are ways to enter into the United States legally. You have to be a citizen to do most things so if they truly want a better life, get your visa. We will happily allow you to come be here if you truly worked hard for it. ","Yes"
0,"I don't think that prison is the best option for people who enter the country illegally. Depending on the situation, just sending the person back to their home country would probably be the best option. Otherwise, our prisons will become crowded with people who really shouldn't be there.  ","No"
1,"He is violent and will offend in the US. He should be deported immediately.","Yes"
0,"He didn't commit any crime where someone was harmed, a simple deportation is enough.","No"
0,"No, but he should be deported to his home country, or given an opportunity to become a citizen, depending on his background and whether he has the potential to commit criminal activity. Despite it, he still entered the country illegally and there should be ramifications for this.","No"
1,"He should be simply sent back to his mother nation. Illegal entry does not count as something US government can punish him with.","No"
1,"This dangerous criminal should be deported back to his country. There should be zero reason as to why the burden of this criminal should be placed on the backs of the tax payers. Make sure he is returned to his country and given to the correct authorities.","No"
1,"The offender was previously deported following a violent crime and the fact that he was able to re-enter the United States showcases that his government is either unwilling or unable to prosecute him or prevent him from re-entering the United States.  In the face of such inaction on behalf of his home nation, it falls to the United States to ensure that he does not re-enter our society, and the only obvious way to do so is to detain him.  Due to this, I would suggest that such an individual be imprisoned.","Yes"
0,"The 28yr old man did not commit a violent crime or robbery,  so I don't see him as a threat or a reason for him to be imprisoned because we'd waste taxpayer money on this individual. He should be detained temporarily, but only until a full background check is made. His information should then be sent to the immigration office to keep track of this individual.","No"
0,"I don't think the man should be send to prison but they should be removed from the USA and sent back to their country of origin. If they were a legitimate asylum seeker/refugee, they should have presented themselves at the port of entry to file a claim for their circumstances. Entering illegally is dishonest and attempts to go around the law.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"This person is a criminal. He should be arrested and send back to his own country. USA does not need any more criminals.","Yes"
0,"This is his only offense, help him get home and help him gain legal entry. No reason to jail him when hes commited no offense that hurt anyone","No"
0,"He should go to jail even if it is just for a month. This would give authorities the time to produce documentation on the illegal alien and insure he is sent back to his country of origin","Yes"
0,"If his only crime was entering the US illegally, I would investigate further into his reasoning for coming here. Perhaps give him a probation period allowing him some time to gather all necessary documents and save up enough money to become a citizen, especially if his goal was to work and go to school here.","No"
0,"The gentleman should not be sent to prison as this was essentially a victimless crime.  Assuming he would be deported, which would be punishment enough.  ","No"
1,"My opinion is that this man should be deported.  It doesn't seem to make sense to send somebody to prison just for the crime of entering the country illegally.  Also, that would be expensive for US taxpayers.  But he shouldn't be welcomed to this country either.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"I feel that they should follow the law in this regard. If there is a way for him to be legalized, he should do so, if not, he can go back to his country.","No"
0,"For most first offenses that do not harm others, there are no prison sentences given out. Even drug dealers and drunk drivers who put lives in danger aren't given prison on their first offense. ","No"
0,"No record of imprisonment. Would probably make a good citizen in the end.","No"
1,"I don't think that he should go to prison I think that he should be sent to his home country.","No"
1,"If you have already committed a violent crime, you should know not to re-offend. Those who break the law with prior crimes should have stiffer consequences as a deterrent.","Yes"
1,"Depending on the circumstances of the previous incarcerations, deportation could be a much simpler option","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"Since he had served two prison sentences each more than a year, he has a bad history of crime. Since we had deported him once before because of a violent crime, I do not think he should be allowed to in the country.","Yes"
0,"I don't think this is an effective punishment at all. This is costly and a burden on the prison system (which is probably already too bloated). A better method would be taking steps to becoming a legal citizen.","No"
0,"He should be deported, they should not house him in the united states jails.","No"
0,"I think prison is too harsh unless he committed a crime. I think he should be deported back to his own country and pay a fine. Maybe he should do prison time upon a second offense.","No"
0,"I don't think American tax payer dollars should go to paying for someone's care in jail for someone who is not also an American citizen. There was no injury to person or property and this person does not seem like a criminal threat.","No"
1,"He has a history of violence in a short time span. There is no sign that this pattern is going to stop at his present time.","Yes"
0,"He has caused no harm by entering the country illegally. He is not a danger to anyone. The government should not involve themselves with him.","No"
1,"Because of the fact that the immigrant has been known to be violent in the past. Therefore he should not be allowed to be violent in the U.S.","Yes"
1,"He should be redeported. He is not worth the tax money to house, feed and care for in prison. There are already too many people in our prisons that don't belong there as is.","No"
1,"Just deport him again. Why should taxpayers pay for his jail time? And build the wall so he can't come back in.","No"
1,"The individual shows a pattern of disdain for the law, considering the previous convictions with time served, one of which involved violence. He should be deported again after his sentence for this most recent violation and should be warned of increasingly serious consequences should he return. ","Yes"
1,"I think this person should be deported. I think his presence in the US hurts the case for other undocumented immigrants who are lawfully living in this country without felony convictions. I think fighting for this person right to stay here jeopardizes the right of the majority of undocumented immigrants that their only lawlessness came when they crossed the border.","Yes"
0,"He should not because he should just be deported. If he goes to prison, now we still pay for his living here even though its prison.","No"
0,"I think he should be listened to. The reason why he crossed illegally should be heard. Perhaps it was to escape a dangerous situation or something similar. If anything, he should be deported. He should not be imprisoned.  If there is a valid reason for coming here, he should be given assistance ","No"
1,"The age of this man (as long as he is under 70) is irrelevant here. Another countries citizen who illegally entered the U.S. had committed a crime under today's laws. I'm more in favor of an open, border-less system, but given this scenario I have to judge by the laws of today. If this man has many previous convictions and is an obvious danger to society, he should not be outside of jail. It's possible that he committed these crimes when he was much younger. It's also possible that he had to do these things in order to survive. Again, it's also possible that he only wanted to get out of it and came in illegally because it could be years or potentially never that he would be allowed legally inside with his record. Still, I have to go on the assumption that he is in control of his actions and therefore recommend jail time.","Yes"
1,"I am up in the air on this. I would like to learn more about his previous convictions. He had been sentenced for a violent crime, but perhaps he was he was just guilty of trying to stop the Russian infiltration of Crimea and the Russians sent him away. If this is the case, maybe he does not need sent to prison. Perhaps he was trying to enter the US to make a better situation for himself.If he was convicted of assaulting someone without """"good intentions"""" (weird phrasing, I know), then he should be sent to prison while immigration works on deportation.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"I WOULD POSSIBLY THINK THAT S/HE HAVE A BAD PURPOSE ANY SUCH HING THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS IN COUNTRY, BECAUSE IF S/HE HAVE A CLEAN INTENTION TO ENTER TO A CERTAIN COUNTY S/HE WILL PROVIDE THE PROOF THAT S/HES VISIT IS TO DO A BUSINESS OR RELATIVE ,","Yes"
1,"He appears to be a repeat offender.  This poses a risk to the rest of society.","Yes"
1,"Since he is here illegally and committed a violent crime and he should be sent to prison. After his prison sentence, he should be sent back to his country and not be let back into the U.S.","Yes"
0,"The U.S. government should not do anything except maybe deporting the person. Prison is not needed as the person does not need to be rehabilitated or corrected. It is a waste of time and money to have this person in prison.","No"
0,"I think that he should be possibly deported, but should not spend any time in prison. That would do him no good, and paying for his punishment doesn't help anyone. ","No"
1,"He had already been given a chance to be here but committed a violent crime and was deported. He should not be allowed to return and should not keep trying. I feel like he needs to receive a consequence so he stops repeating this offense.","Yes"
0,"I don't believe this person belongs in jail, because he hasn't committed a crime that has hurt anyone else. He should either be deported or given a chance to gain lawful citizenship.","No"
1,"We don't need criminals illegally coming to the country. They US government should put him in prison and then deport him, alerting his home country to his crimes.","Yes"
1,"This person is a known criminal who has been convicted of violent crimes. In addition, they are in the country illegally. They should definitely go to prison as it is likely they will break more laws.","Yes"
0,"I don't think this warrants imprisonment.  I believe deportation would be sufficient.","No"
1,"","Yes"
1,"He should serve a prison sentence of a year and then be deported. I think he deserves jail time because of his repeated offenses.","Yes"
0,"It seems as though he is not a criminal if he has no prior arrest. For one reason or another, he has fled his native homeland. Prison isn't the answer. ","No"
1,"They should send him to prison because he is a previous offender. He has already had multiple chances to fix things.","Yes"
1,"I think that if he was caught illegally entering the United States from another country, he should be held under the law. Although I do not agree with putting the man in prison in the United States, because he is not from the United States. It costs money to put people in prison, and I don't think the United States should spend money on convicting non-citizens. If however the question means the person is sent to prison in their own country, then yes I agree with that. I say this mostly people he had been convicted before and hasn't learned from his mistakes.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"The person already has a record of violent crime and has shown that they have no regard towards the laws of another country. The recidivism rate in the US is extremely high, so the odds are against the person. They will commit a crime again. ","Yes"
1,"He should be sent to prison and then deport him back to his country. He is a violent offender and needs to be punished and not allowed in this country any longer.","Yes"
1,"Sending him to pirson would just add to the expense on the prison/tax payers. He should be deported again. As a last resort if he's caught again he should serve at least 5 years in prison, while it would cost us more perhaps he will learn and once released and deported not return.","No"
0,"Jail time for illegally entering the country is extreme if no other crime was committed.  Give him all the info he needs to apply to enter legally, if there is no chance, deport him immediately.  If there is a chance, give him a chance to apply.","No"
0,"I don't think that qualifies as an imprisonable offense.","No"
0,"This person, if caught, should be deported where they can apply for a proper visa.  They should not be imprisoned while this process plays out.","No"
1,"He should be deported given his violent criminal history.","No"
1,"He is a violent criminal.  He needs to serve jail time and then be deported.","Yes"
0,"It is hard for immigrants to gain citizenship the legal way. It may be illegal, but there are so many legal citizens getting away so much worse things than entering a country. Like our President for starters.","No"
1,"They should take different precautions towards this individual. Other incarcerations have not worked, the countries need to look at a solution to problems like this.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He has multiple offenses and has proven he has no intention of becoming a law abiding citizen. So, unless the sentence is life. He should be deported.","No"
0,"He should be processed by immigration to see if he has the ability to legally stay in the country (such as a refugee). If that's not the case, his illegal entry should be recorded and he should be returned to his home country.","No"
1,"Respect is a feeling of admiration or deference toward a person, child, non-human animal, group, ideal, or indeed almost any entity or concept, as well as specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of the one respected (e.g., """"I have great respect for her judgment""""). It can also be conduct in accord with a specific ethic of respect.","Yes"
0,"Regardless of being caught or convicted of any previous crimes, he has committed this crime. Illegally entering into a state is a crime, it has consequences. He should be detained, and have to answer for his crime against the US and its people.","Yes"
1,"he should be departed.  No reason to spend money to send him to prison.","No"
0,"wanting to improve your quality of life is not a crime. the man should be screened for desirable qualities and  professional skills and then sent home to go through the actual immigration process.","No"
0,"Since he didn't have a record, he probably moved as a last resort and wouldn't have been able to do it legally, or he likely would have done so. I think something like community service is more apt and less harsh.","No"
0,"Anyone caught entering illegally should be deported back to their country. There are many ways to come legally. Laws should be obeyed and practiced.","No"
0,"The man should be imprisoned as he entered the country illegally. After the imprisonment, he should be returned to his country at his own expense.","Yes"
1,"While a prison sentence isn't appropriate for illegal entry of the US the person in question has served time before. The fact that they committed a violent crime in the past means they need to be deported asap. If they try it a third time then I suppose deportation isn't gonna work and they should probably serve a lengthy prison stay.","Yes"
0,"He has no criminal records and presumable poses no threat to citizens' well being.  His only crime is being here illegally.   US jails are already overcrowded.","No"
0,"His punishment should be deportation. Jailing this man would cost taxpayers more, and it is an excessive punishment for the crime. He was just trying to improve his life, and has done no harm to Americans.","No"
0,"Since this is a first offense, prison should not be an option. However, I do believe she should be issued a DUI.","No"
0,"No, he should not be imprisoned in the USA. He is here illegally and should be deported back to the country he is from. ","No"
1,"He shouldn't be sent to prison in this country, at least. American taxpayer should not pay any money to imprison him. He should be sent back to his own country.","No"
1,"The U.S government should sentence this man for about 5 years to prison for his action. He had done more than once already, so he needs to be punished more severely.","Yes"
1,"Since he was caught doing something illegally, he should have to pay for his crime. The fact that he has prior crimes against him, seems he is dangerous and should be punished. ","Yes"
0,"I am strictly against illegals coming into this country therefore I believe anyone that comes to this country illegally should be sent to prison.  At the very least, those people should be made to go back to their own country.","Yes"
1,"If he convicted a crime such as illegal entering to this country it means he went against the law. If he did it he deserves to follow the law. Moreover, he needs to serve the prison and than being deported back again. There is no respect if this guy does this crime again and again","Yes"
1,"Being deported the first time was almost like probation. He broke the law again by sneaking back in which is 2 strikes against him. Since he has chosen to break the law to come to this country, he should be subject to our countries laws. He should serve time under the habitual criminal act.","Yes"
1,"He should not be sent to prison for simply trying to enter the US.  He should be deported.","No"
1,"I believe that this person needs to go to prison and then promptly be deported.  Unfortunately, a past history of violent crime is a strong indicator that they might perpetuate more violent crime.  I don't believe that this person has demonstrated that they truly want to be a citizen of the U.S.  Rather, they are opportunistic and will resort to violence and crime when it is convenient for them.","Yes"
0,"They should find out more about his background.  If found to be in good standing in his country, should be sent to a government (usa) resources center.  Inform him what he needs to do to become legal, provide resources. Even if he is sent back to his country he should be able to apply, now that he he has more info.","No"
1,"He should be jailed because obviously he cannot be trusted to follow the law since he has been previously convicted of a violent crime and entered the country illegally.  No one should come here illegally, and if a criminal is here illegally, the country should punish him to the full extent possible under the law.","Yes"
0,"We should not be excessive in punishing a person looking for a better life. We should return them but not imprison them.","No"
1,"He should be deported instead. If he illegally renters the US once again then he should serve some time. I'm not sure how much.","No"
1,"I believe they should either lock him up, having him serve time for committing the same crime again or send him back to wherever he entered ther US from illegally. They make him spend time in jail there. ","Yes"
0,"The processes around coming into the US are lengthy and difficult. The US is a melting pot of individuals. This person came here and is living responsibly. This is the type of person we need here in America. The conviction should walk this person through becoming a US citizen.","No"
0,"They committed no other crime. So I think just entering illegally should be a fine.","No"
1,"No he shouldn't be in prison. Illegally entering the country should not be a criminal offense.","No"
0,"If he has never been imprisoned before, then he doesn't sound like a criminal. He should be deported maybe but not imprisoned.  It seems wrong to send someone to jail for trying to make a better life for themselves.","No"
1,"Entering the US illegally is against the law so it should be dealt with accordingly. He also has a history of violence so he should be sent to prison.","Yes"
0,"If the person is from another country and illegally enters the US instead of prison they should be sent back. If they go to prison they'd still be in the US and money will still be spent on them.","No"
1,"No, he should not be sent to prison.  He should be deported back to his country this costs money, but is probably cheaper than putting him in prison here and then deporting him.","No"
0,"Given that he had no prior convictions before it seems harsh and a waste of government money to put the guy in jail. The best course of action would be to deport him.","No"
1,"This guy broke the law and he is bad for our country.   We need to make sure he learns that he is not welcome here.","Yes"
0,"","Yes"
1,"He should stay in prison in the United States until being deported to another country. He should not be allowed to reenter the US under any circumstances.","Yes"
0,"They should just send him back to his home country and tell him not to come back. We can not just let anyone into the USA. If he wants to get into the USA there are other legal options.","No"
0,"","No"
0,"The act of entering is itself an illegal act, but is in and of itself not malicious.  Prison should be kept as a resort for violent individuals, or those who refuse to cooperate with non incarceration punishment.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"If the citizen entered the US illegally, he should just be sent back to his home country.  Because the man has never been imprisoned before, the only punishment should be deportation.","No"
1," Yes, I do believe he should go to prison and be held there. I also believe that he should be deported back to his country as soon as possible today due to the fact that he is here illegally and has committed crimes. ","Yes"
1,"Because he broke the law on the same offense, he should be sent back to prison again. Then, after serving his sentence, he should be deported.","Yes"
1,"This person has a history of violence. I feel he has also not learned his lesson yet since he is a repeat offender.","Yes"
0,"The U.S. government should deportment him back to his country. Depending on how he spent his time in the U.S. the court should decide whether he goes to prison first or is immediately deported. If he was found to have abided U.S. law while in the country, then he should be allowed to legally immigrant after sent back to his country if he passes a harder version of the test. If he was found to commit multiple crimes while he was here than he should be sentence than deported without an option of legally coming back.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1," I think this man should be deported. America should not incur the cost of food/clothes/shelter for a criminal. Depending on the severity of the crime, his country should be notified of it (if it's a violent crime) to make them aware of his risk to them.","No"
0,"We need to evaluate why he was trying to flee his country and enter ours. Sometimes people are forced to enter a new country out of desperation and no one wants to be a criminal.","No"
0,"The U.S. government should detain the man. He should have a trial to determine his punishment. That would be the fair thing to do.","Yes"
1,"This man has already been convicted twice. One crime was of the violent nature. Deport him immediately!","Yes"
0,"I feel prison is a harsh sentence for someone entering a country illegally, I feel placing them in jail for a short term is more appropriate. This way police can question the person as to why they entered the country, and determine if he is a threat or not. ","No"
0,"He should not be sent to prison because it would be very expensive to house this man in American prisons. The U.S. government should deport the man to his country of origin after a trial convicting him of illegally entering the country without a valid reason for asylum.","No"
1,"This person should remain in prison until he can be deported. He should be kept in solitary confinement with minimal time out of his cell, minimal food and no commissary.  If he's caught in the US again, he should spend life in a US prison and the origin country should be charged each year for the cost of his imprisonment.","Yes"
1,"This person has a past history of crime so they should be handled as such. I think he should serve jail time.","Yes"
1,"If he had just been convicted of illegally entering the country, then he should simply be deported back to his home country. But since this person has gone to prison once before for committing a violent crime, he should go to prison to prevent him from coming back into the U.S. and committing another violent crime.","Yes"
1,"He should be detained for entering but he otherwise hasn't broken a law.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The government should check his background for criminal history. The government should also have talk/inquire the motive behind this action.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I don't even know the moral ethics of illegal entry anymore. The government should let him in but if the sentences he had prior to this were very severe then they should exercise caution.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"he has a criminal past.  now he is here illegally, so i wouldn't give him any leeway","Yes"
0,"He should be deported. He should not go to jail.","No"
0,"Regardless of his citizenship status, he should pay for the crime he committed.  Whether or not he is in the country is irrelevant when it comes to a crime committed.","Yes"
0,"I believe the government should allow the offender to apply for legal residency in the United States. If the offender refuses, he should be forced to return to his home country without penalty.","No"
0,"If this person has no prior criminal record, I do not see the purpose of sending him to prison. The man should be interviewed to determine if he should be granted asylum or if he should be returned to the country he came from.","No"
0,"I don't think illegally entering the country should be enough to send someone to jail. If they had weapons or hard drugs with them then I may change my mind, but I think the most that should happen is deportation back to the individuals home country.","No"
1,"Should be sent to prison after being convicted. When released he should be deported to his country and not be allowed to ever come to the US again",""
0,"He broke the law, there are legal ways to come here. If i broker the law I'd get in trouble.","Yes"
0,"This person should be fined and deported instead of being sent to prison. If his only crime is illegally entering the country, imprisonment seems like nothing but an added expense for US taxpayers.","No"
1,"They should deport the person. He is likely to recommit a violent offense.","No"
1,"Any crime by an illegal or legal person  should be punished. Since the person only was only found illegal than deportation i enough.","No"
1,"Our government spends way to much money and time tracking down the same people over and over. We have enough problems with legal citizens that are criminals. We don't need to be spending all of our resources chasing down the same illegal criminals over and over again.","Yes"
1,"The man should be deported. He is not authorized to be in the country, and has a history of violent criminal behavior so we have good reason to not want him. His country of citizenship should be informed of any wrongdoing that our government is aware that he might have engaged in in case that country wants to employ their own criminal justice system.","No"
1,"If he commits a crime in this country he should go through our court system then be deported.  His criminal background is grounds for immediate deportation.","No"
1,"Being a repeat offender I think jail is in order.  He's already been through the criminal justice system and knows what he's doing. If he's here illegally he should be deported.","Yes"
0,"He is not a criminal , he is looking to change his life. I think with most first offenses other then murder people don't go to prison . I think that he should be deported back . It should be swift so hes not in limbo and doesn't have to go to jail. ","No"
1,"This person was and is a convicted felon, respectively. This person is in the united states illegally and was previously convicted of a crime which he as imprisoned for for over a year, this person should be deported","Yes"
1,"He has already been sent back and didn't stay.  Now he should have a nice long prison sentence, then be sent back.","Yes"
1,"This person should spend time in Prison, He's already had too many chances and he didn't learn from them.  Yes he should spend time in prison or stay in his own country.","Yes"
1,"Yes, he was breaking a crime, by entering this country illegally.  He has prior record of violent crimes, we need these kind of people behind bars so our streets can be safer.","Yes"
0,"They did not commit a serious crime. This was also their first offense.","No"
1,"The person had prior trouble with the law and he also entered into a country illegally. The offender should be sent to prison and proper action will be taken.","Yes"
1,"This man should serve another short prison sentence and then be immediately deported. His prior violent crime conviction means that he is a danger to U.S. citizens. The fact that he has continued to attempt illegal entry should come with a prison sentence to try to discourage him from trying again. Merely deporting him means he could turn around and try again. He might think twice if he has to serve time.","Yes"
0,"Before making a decision, I would like to know why the man chose to enter the United States. If he was being prosecuted by another country, I would not send him to jail; instead I would work to make him a legal citizen. If he chose to enter this country illegally in order to commit crimes (which I doubt, as he has never been convicted of committing a crime before), I would be more inclined to imprison or deport him.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I think this individual should be sent to prison.  He served a prison sentence and was then deported.  Clearly his native country is not administering any consequences, and if we deport him without imprisoning him, he is going to end up back in the United States within weeks and could potentially pose a threat or danger to innocent an legal American citizens.  He should be locked up.  Deporting him again will do nothing to deter his criminality.  And, if he has already been convicted of a violent crime, the likelihood of him re-offending is high.  He should not be free to roam the streets of America.","Yes"
0,"I believe that this person should be deported immediately.  We should not allow someone to stay in this country if their first act is to violate the laws of this country.  Furthermore, as a taxpayer, i do not want this country to take on the financial responsibility of keeping this person in jail.","No"
1,"He should due to him being in prison before. Also because one of his previous crimes was considered violent so he should be in custody.","Yes"
1,"This individual has had a violent crime on his record, and should not be allowed to stay in this country with that on his record. ","Yes"
0,"He should be deported, but there's no reason to waste time and resources holding him in our overcrowded prisons. Illegal immigrants who did no other offense are still ILLEGAL immigrants - they did violate our laws - but they should simply be removed from the country.","No"
1,"This person should either be sent to prison then deported or deported. American immigration law should allow people wanting to immigrate for work or family or a better life, not to commit violent crimes. It is my opinion that immigrants who commit violent crimes should be deported and not allowed to enter the U.S. again.","Yes"
1,"The man has served time for a violent offense in the past. He has displayed a pattern of criminal behavior and will likely continue to do so if he was released. He has been deported before and is back in the country illegally again, so I see no other option. ","Yes"
0,"They have no record. Let them stay.","No"
0,"No he should not be put in jail. He should just be made to go home and showed how to come here properly next time and be grounded from coming back for like 90 days or something.","No"
1,"I don't think the US government needs to get involved but I do feel this person needs to serve for the crime committed.  That should go for anyone that gets caught in a crime, regardless if they are from the US or not.  I don't feel they need to be deported but serving time is being fair.","Yes"
0,"It needs to be determined the reason for entering the country illegally. Even though he has never been imprisoned before, it is important to take the action seriously and check if there had been any prior attempts to enter or similar offenses.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"They should be deported, not imprisoned","No"
0,"No he should not go to prison because he doesn't have a prior record and his only crime is entering the United States illegally. He should be allowed to stay in the United States and try to make a life for himself as long as he follows the law.","No"
0,"I believe that the offense of illegally entering the United States should be a misdemeanor to be paid with a fine.  Furthermore, to make it a felony or an 'exportable' offense is something that is decidedly the opposite of American values.  We should be welcoming people who are not committing crimes and make a way to allow them to enter our society legally.  Perhaps instead of a 'green' card they could be given a 'blue' card or something that says, hey, their on their way to earning citizenship. ","No"
0,"The person has not committed any other crime except for crossing the border and does not appear to be any kind of a threat to the security of the country entered. The person should be detained and then deported back to the country of origin. There should not be any prison time given to the individual.","No"
1,"its either go back to your country if you have a bad reputation or go in and do things right","Yes"
0,"I don't think he should be put in prison.  He should be referred to immigration for investigation.  If he is from a country that would put his life in danger if he returned to it, possibly he should be granted asylum.  It's complicated.  If he is from a country where he would be safe if he returned to it, he should be deported back to it.","No"
0,"The U.S. government should simply deport him.  Why should we pay for the prison expense of a non-US citizen?","No"
0,"There are easy and proper ways to enter the United States, finding them and applying for them to become a natural citizen should be immigrants priorities. Often coming in illegally, and not knowing our laws results in penalties/fines/jail time. If they want to come over let them, but do so legally and properly with paperwork and courses to become an American.","Yes"
0,"He has no history of violence. He would be criminalized in prison.","No"
0,"All this gentleman did was cross the border illegally, he did not commit any other crime that would put him in our jails. If he was sent to a U.S. prison, Americans would have to pay taxes to keep him there. I believe this individual should be given a chance to start the application to become a legal citizen within x amount of days or be deported.","No"
0,"He should be sent back to his country rather than being imprisoned here and wasting our tax dollars on him. The U.S. government should see why he came here also and what country he came from.","No"
0,"If he has never been imprisoned and isn't on any terrorism watch list, he should be offered the option and a path to become a legal immigrant if he wishes to live here.  If not, then he should be sent back to his country of origin.","No"
0,"He entered the country illegally and thus should be punished, however, he should not go to prison.  Instead he should be deported d back to his country.  Going to prison is only going to cause taxpayers dollars being spent unnecessarily and. It for the citizens.  Prison is going to cost citizens money.","No"
0,"They should simply be deported. They have never committed another crime, and their actions were not violent. This is simply a minor violation","No"
1,"I think that this man should be sent to prison because he broke the law. He has already been deported for other crimes, if he stays he might do more crimes.","Yes"
1,"This man shouldn't be hosted in a US prison at taxpayer expense. He should be deported again to his home country as he rightly was before.","No"
0,"He came to the United States illegally while thousands of other go through the process. He should be imprisoned and sent back to his country.","Yes"
1,"I believe he is likely to commit a serious crime again. He should be deported, and sent out of the country. He is a detriment to our country.","Yes"
1,"He should be sent back to his home country. If he goes to prison his trial, food, healthcare and lodging will be paid with taxpayers dollars. It's bad enough we have to pay for legal citizens to stay in prison, we should not have to pay for illegal immigrants as well, the burden is already great.","No"
1,"The person should serve a prison sentence to pay for his crime. He clearly does not respect the laws of our country so he should receive and serve a harsher sentence before deportation. His previous offenses, especially with one of them being a violent crime, make him a dangerous person. DNA and finger prints should also be obtained and kept on record.","Yes"
0,"Sometimes people are looking for  a better life. They want to live happier and be happier.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should be put in prison. He is an illegal and can not keep out of trouble. This just add to the crime rate in the United States.","Yes"
1,"The U.S. government should send the offender back to his home country where he should be sentenced to prison for disobeying the law.","Yes"
1,"Yes, because he's a past criminal and he clearly hasn't learned his lesson since he was already deported so simply deporting him isn't enough.","Yes"
0,"The person broke the law plain and simple. These laws are in place for a reason and we need to enforce them.","Yes"
0,"I don't think our already inundated prison system needs additional residents especially those who were not acting in a way that they would be dangerous to society, however, they did break the law and should be held to account for their actions. They should be sent to their country of origin and lose the right to be allowed to enter legally for a certain period. I think this is fair. Our laws need respected. What kind of sovereign nation would we be if we didn't respect our own laws?","No"
1,"I believe the person should be sent back to his country because he is an illegal and his native country should handle the problem as far as his deserved punishment.","No"
0,"Persons caught entering the US illegally should be detained and deported to their home country in most cases, as long as they are not participating in criminal activity which would cause any legal US citizen to be imprisoned.  Citizens of foreign countries who are at war or will otherwise be killed in their home countries should be granted political asylum on a case by case basis.","No"
1,"I think this person should go in prison because it's not the first time he commits a crime.Committing a violent crime the time before, he had already shown that he did not deserve hospitality.","Yes"
1,"I feel that entering the US illegally as well as having committed a violent crime means he poses a threat to any citizen he comes in contact. He is a proven criminal. He deserves to be locked up.","Yes"
0,"Since the man had no previous criminal record sending him to prison is unwarranted. The government should deport him.","No"
1,"I don't think the government should put him in prison. I think at worst they should just send him back to his own country unless he is escaping persecution or will be punished when he returns. I don't think  that it's really harming anyone or thing to enter the country illegally, so it shouldn't be punished by time. ","No"
0,"This person is in the country illegally which is already a crime and should be put in prison or deported back home to their country.","Yes"
1,"If he was only convicted of entering the US illegally, then he should be deported. Having been convicted of a violent crime previously should not weigh in on this case if there was no violent crime committed.","No"
1,"He has already served time for his crime. People grow up, and they change. Many people have made their lives here and shouldn't be punished again.","No"
1,"This person should be sent back to prison. The reason I think that is because he had been to prison before so he obviously did not learn.","Yes"
0,"Should be turned over to ICE and deported to his home country. If that involves a short stay in prison so be it but deportation not prison should be the primary goal. If there is a case for refugee status that should be taken into consideration.","No"
1,"The person shouldn't be sent to prison in America. S/he should be deported back to his/her country of citizenship and handed over to the judiciary in that country. The financial/time burden on convicting the person of illegally entering the country would be large.","No"
1,"To begin with, the person is a criminal who has shown he will flaunt the law for his own gain, which is exactly what ALL illegal immigrants are. When you add to that the other criminal charges, this man should be sent out of this country immediately and never allowed to return under penalty of some sort of hard-time prison, such as one where you must perform a LOT of work each day.","Yes"
0,"They should question the man to find out why he was entering the country. If it is determined that he is seeking employment or safety they should take this into consideration. At the most they could send him back but I think it is most likely that he has a positive reason for entering the country and they can help him go through the proper channels to become a citizen.","No"
0,"Although the 27 year old woman endangered others and committed a crime this was her first offense and the prisons are over croweded and often sent to prison too often. In my opinion this woman should be given the option to take a class about driving under the influence and given community service along with a fine.","No"
0,"I feel that our immigration policies are too strict and that we should be more flexible with individuals of other nationalities who would like to enter our country to work. With that said, I would need to have a better idea of why this particular person was entering the US and what he had with him before making a determination. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Prison would be too harsh of a sentence for illegal immigration. Maybe sent back to their original country, but not imprisoned.","No"
0,"The illegal immigrant shouldn't be imprisioned but prosecuted and sent back to his own country since its the man first offense and be told if he does it again he will be prosecuted and imprisioned the next time it happens.","No"
1,"I think the government should deport him.  We don't need to pay our taxpayer dollars to support him in our prison.","No"
1,"He should be sent back to his home country. Why should we keep him in our prisons.","No"
1,"He already has a previous record of a violent crime and being illegal is a crime still. He has a chance of committing a crime again.","Yes"
0,"Prison is not going to fix the motivation people have for immigrating. They should be allowed the proper channels to immigrate and be deported if they do not comply.","No"
0,"He was coming here to try and better himself or family. If he was not doing anything then being illegally here i would not want him in jail taking up money and resources that could go to other things to help out the economy.","No"
0,"I believe that the U.S should imprison the man for a minimum of four months before being sent back to their home country. This will hopefully become a determent to those that try to illegally entering the United States","Yes"
0,"Think the person should likely just be deported because he was probably just trying to make a better life for himself. Seems like a waste of our resources to (since housing an inmate is so expensive), so really only benefits people affiliated with the prison industrial complex.","No"
0,"It doesn't seem as though the man poses a threat, so I'm reluctant to say that he deserves to be imprisoned. He did, however, enter the country illegally. When actual citizens break the law, they are sentenced to jail time, so I don't see why it should be any different with others. Also, if I were caught entering another country illegally, I would fully expect to face serious legal consequences.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"This person should be sent to prison because he committed a crime. Once he does his time he should be allowed back in society like other prisoners.","Yes"
1,"Yes, because he is likely to do something similar again. Also, it is illegal to enter the US without going through the proper channels.","Yes"
0,"The key word here is illegally.   If he isn't here legally, he needs to be punished according to the law and not allowed to stay here.   He should try to come here via the legal method, and he wouldnt have to worry about going to jail.  very simple.  ","Yes"
0,"If you put the ones you catch in prison when you catch them maybe less will want to try it. I would hope that would be the result.","Yes"
1,"The offender has more than one past crimes committed. Letting them go free could even endanger other citizens","Yes"
1,"I am favor of just sending him back. Enough wasting tax payers money. Him living in USA prison is actually a higher standard of living than his country. He gets room and food everyday.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"This 28-year-old man should just be deported and not be sent to prison. If he gets sent to prison, it does no good and people tax money will just fund him to stay in there.","No"
1,"I answered yes to the question, but really the person should be deported back to their home country.  This is a previous offender of violent crimes and should not be allowed to continue to be in this country, even in prison. ","Yes"
1,"He has done time for violent crimes. So I don't want him here.","Yes"
1,"Because he entered the United States in a way in which he was not supposed to do so. He could have Google'd ''legal ways to enter the United States'' and could have tried those first.","Yes"
0,"He should be sent to prison for a very short stint to punish him for what he's done, and then given the tools to immigrate legally.","Yes"
1,"The scenario didn't mention whether the person had violated his probation or whether the government has some legal justification for putting him in prison.  My feeling that he should go to prison isn't legally relevant.","No"
1,"This man has already served time for his previous crime. Since other illegal immigrants are not sent to prison for entering illegally, this man should not be unfairly punished for his past crimes (which he already paid for). If he is caught doing illegal violent crimes in America, then he should be rightly punished.","No"
0,"Prison is not the answer. Our prisons are already severely overpopulated and with this being the person first offense, I don't feel prison will improve the situation. A fine and deportation would be more effective.","No"
0,"This person should be sent to prison, but only temporarily until the can be deported. Crime is crime. You've got to pay.","Yes"
0,"This person does not deserve to be punished. Although they did not follow the rules, there should be other options that can help this person rather than sending him to prison.","No"
0,"I don't believe in borders. Give this man a fine and let him be on his way. Unless they have outstanding warrants or are carrying narcotics, who cares? Let them be.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison because no matter your status if you do the crime you should do the time. People should be held accountable.","Yes"
1,"He had previous offences. That means he's liable to be a repeat offender and commit possibly worse crimes as well as become a threat to society.","Yes"
1,"I do not know the law in this regard.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"She was putting herself and others in danger.  She broke the law.","Yes"
1,"This person have to send back to his country for be back to the country after deportation.  The government has to send back directly to a prison in his country to make sure he is going to stay for a while.","Yes"
1,"He is a known felon illegally entering the USA. Since he had a violent crime on his sheet, he should be deported back to his home country after serving a sentence commiserate with the laws on illegal aliens","Yes"
0,"I would not be okay with my tax dollars being used to feed and house him. He should be deported, but should not be put in prison. ","No"
1,"this man is a repeat offender","Yes"
1,"Instead of going to jail, this person should be deported back to his home country. This can be justified by the fact that he had past infractions, one of them violent. ","No"
1,"Illegally entering the country is a crime. It's long past time for this country to start punishing these people in order to send a message that if you come here illegally, you're going to jail and then you're going to get the boot from the country permanently.","Yes"
1,"I think the offender should be deported back to his home country and not held within a US prison. He should not have to serve jail time in a US prison because of a crime he previously committed. He should just have to go back to the country that he illegally entered from because he has proven himself to be a criminal and had been deported previously as a result.","No"
0,"I dont know what his circumstances are. They should try to go through it as a legal process.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"This is her first offense. She should be taken back to her country.","No"
1,"I think that this person should be jailed for at least a few days and then immediately sent back to his country. He should be jailed for crossing illegally so that the U.S. has a record that he violated the law and that he'd have to face higher penalties if he tries to do this again the future.","Yes"
0,"The Federal Government should deport him to his home country.  While I am fine with allowing an increase in the number of immigrants allowed into this country, I do think that the country should deport those who are caught in the country illegally - or else why even have a law","No"
0,"He should be sent back to his host nation. He shouldn't be able to stay.","No"
1,"Just as this vignette explained, this man """"was convicted"""", so like any other person - illegal or not- he should be subject to the same pusishment for being convicted for whatever crime just like any other person would be punished.","Yes"
0,"Because its not worth the cost. I think they should return him back to his country unless he is seeking status as a refugee.","No"
0,"If he has never commited any other crimes, then he should not be put in prison just for entering the country ilegally. Give him the chance to go through the proper procedures to become a citizen.","No"
1,"He's been to prison before. He's been deported before. He will continue coming back no matter if we deport him or not.","Yes"
1,"This individual is obviously a repeat offender.  He will most likely commit further crimes in the future. He should be deported after serving time.","Yes"
0,"i believe any illegal alien that is caught in the country should be given an opportunity to prove worthiness of being here. if the immigrant can not show a way of being a productive member of our society then they should be deported. if they are willing to become a contributing member of our society and pay taxes like the rest of us than I dont see any reason they shouldn't be allowed to stay.","No"
1,"The person seems not to be a good citizen from his past legal records. Also, the person is in the USA illegally.","Yes"
0,"He should be sent back to his country and given the info that he need to come in to this country the right way","No"
0,"He has not committed any crime that means he is a menace to society and should be behind bars, therefore he should not go to prison. He should be asked to return to his home country and/or be assisted in filing the proper paperwork to enter our country.","No"
0,"He should be deported. We should not waste money keeping him in jail.","No"
1,"Generally, I think the proper punishment here is deportation. However, because he has already snuck into the U.S. multiple times, that punishment will not work. Additionally, because he has previously committed violet crimes, he is a risk to the public. As such, prison seems appropriate.","Yes"
1,"Since the man has engaged in a violent crime before, I feel he should face prison time. He should be deported back to the country he came from as a prisoner. Since he has not learned his lesson from being in prison twice, the US should send him back to his country. If he was not doing violent crimes, I feel he could stay in the country.","Yes"
1,"This man has should be deported back to his country.  The U.S governmental authorities should hand him over to the authorities of his country to handle the issue.","No"
0,"I feel that he should definitely not go to prison because he didn't commit a crime that should be punished by going to prison. I think they should instead deport him back to the country he came from. I don't blame people that want to come to our country. I just think they should do it by going thru the legal process.","No"
1,"As he is not a citizen of the country and entered illegally, he should be extradited back to his country of origin, charged with any applicable crimes. If that is not an option he should definitely be placed into custody, and on serving his sentence he can be extradited. ","No"
0,"If anything, the person should be deported if they illegally entered the country. The government should work with the mother nation and repatriate the person as best possible. Prison time would not be appropriate for this situation.","No"
1,"This person has a significant criminal record and should not be allowed in the United States. His record indicates that he will likely continue his criminal behavior if he were allowed into the country, and this should not happen unless he enters legally. ","Yes"
0,"No harm to a person was done, this person does not appear to be violent. Deport them back to their origin country after submitting their information into a database for future reference.","No"
0,"The person should not be sent to prison because this is not a very serious crime. The person did not hurt anyone so he should just be sent back to his country.","No"
0,"I feel like since it's his first time doing something illegal, I think he should be given a warning. If he does something else, then he would be eligible for jail or prison time. ","No"
1,"Yes he should be sent to prison because he is a repeat offender.  He will probably do more harm than good.","Yes"
0,"He should not go to prison, since he did not commit a crime which harmed another person or harmed property. He doesn't seem to be a danger to others or himself. The U.S. government should deport him back to his home country.","No"
1,"No prison should be necessary as they should be deported.  Just escort this person out of the country and, at least for a while, they will not be the problem of the United States.","Yes"
1,"He has already been a convicted felon, and he continues to break laws. He either needs to be deported to his own country or put in Jail in the United States for breaking the law.","Yes"
1,"He has broken the law before and now he is doing it again. There has to be some sort of penalty for past offenders, especially if their offense was a violent crime. I have no idea how long he should be imprisoned before being deported again.","Yes"
1,"Yes because of his past history and leading up to this incident too. Pasts of people don't always  mean anything but in this case he did something illegal by entering the US and who knows what his intent for that actually was.","Yes"
0,"I think the government should first see how long he has been in the country. If it's less than a year, he should be sent back to his own country. If it's more than a year, the government should see whether he has a job, pays taxes, and is a contributor to the country. The government should also examine whether he was escaping violence or war in his own country. After the government has also the facts, they can decide whether to deport him or grant amnesty. ","No"
0,"First it should be determined if the person has entered the country for reasons of seeking protection from their country of origin. If so, their safety should be considered. If not, the entrance should be recorded and the person should be returned to his home country until such time he can achieve legal entry. ","No"
0,"I his only offense was illegally entering the U.S. I believe that he should be sent back to the country he is a legal citizen of.  I do not believe that prison resources should be spent on him, and I do not think that he should be allowed to stay in the U.S.. ","No"
0,"because he entered the country illegally","Yes"
0,"I believe the offender should be sent to prison for the violation. However, his case should be turned over to immigration authorities for review to determine what steps can be taken for the offender to remain in the United States or be deported back to his home country.","Yes"
1,"First, he entered the country illegally. He seems to be violent. Clearly, he does not respects laws.","Yes"
0,"i think that once in the US, people should only be put in jail if they commit an offense that would send a US citizen to jail.  the reason the man came to the US should be considered, and at most, he should be deported not in jail","No"
0,"All he was doing was doing what people have been doing for the entire history of America, which is try to get to a better country. They should just let him know how he can legally enter in the future and put him back in whatever country he came from.","No"
1,"HE WAS A PREVIOUS OFFENDAR AND TRYING TO ENTER THE US IS ILLEGAL AND HE SHOULD PAY FOR HIS CRIME BECAUSE HE WAS CAUGHT","Yes"
1,"This man should definitely serve time in prison. He has already served sentences for a violent crime and therefore cannot be trusted to not be in prison. However, I also think that after he serves his time here that he should be deported to his country and to remain in prison there. I do not think that he should serve a long sentence here in the U.S. since he would basically gaining benefits from us.","Yes"
1,"They should just pull her over. She could call someone to drive her home and make her take classes.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"He violated the laws of our country. On the other hand, the term of punishment should be small.","Yes"
0,"I think that if the person tries to fight or is disruptive he should be arrested and sent back to his country.  Otherwise if he complies to authorities he should not be arrested but work with him and possibly still send him back to his country.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"by law, he is illegal alien.  He should be in jail and wait for deportation","Yes"
1,"This man should be deported again. He has a history of violent crimes and as such is a danger to the country.","Yes"
1,"I believe it is the law to be sent to prison for illegally re-entering the United States. I would recommend this person serve two years of prison time and be given a fine.","Yes"
0,"Sent to prison or back to his home country. I do not think that illegals should be allowed to enter without the proper documents and be where they are not supposed to be. If they do something wrong, they should be punished","Yes"
1,"The person has already been in trouble. He should go to jail.","Yes"
1,"If this person has been convicted of violent crimes in the past, he should not be put into our prison system he should deported back to his country again.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The government should send him back to his home country. He can apply therein.","No"
1,"People do not deserve the opportunity to come to the USA who will cause problems for citizens already established here. He needs to be deported, he does not deserve the chance to even sit in a US prison and drain further taxpayer dollars.","No"
0,"He should be given the chance to go through the proper procedures to enter this country.  Many good people come here hoping for a chance at a better life.","No"
0,"The U.S. government should not send him to prison.  They should ask him why he came into the country and what he plans to do.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison, and then deported back to where ever he came from. Being here illegally is already a crime. But he was deported and then came back. He should be given the maximum allowable sentence and his home country should pay for his incarceration. ","Yes"
1,"He has show a disregard for the laws of our nation and without serving a prison sentence will very likely just come right back to the country upon his inevitable re-deportation. He should serve a minimum sentence of 1 year and upon completion should immediately be deported to his home country (preferably at his own expense if possible). Without consequences for illegally entering the country, people will just come back again.","Yes"
0,"yes  Please describe in at least two sentences what actions if any the U.S. government should take with respect to this perso","Yes"
0,"I think that this person should be sent back to their country.  People should not be in another country illegally.","No"
0,"He should be issued a certain amount of time to come into the country legally. Jail teaches these people nothing, they are just looking for a better life. ","No"
0,"The man is breaking the law. He should go to jail and then deported back to his own country.","Yes"
0,"I don't think this man did anything detrimental enough to society that warranted prison.  I don't see the harm that crossing an artificial border does.","No"
1,"This person should be sent to prison in the country that he was originally from. The U.S. government should not spend anymore time and resources on this person then they already have.","Yes"
1,"This guy should serve some prison time and then be deported. The prison time is to have him think on his crimes and the way that he is living his life. Prison seems a sensible punishment as if he were to be merely deported he would probably return illegally as he had done previously. Serving prison time would show that there is a real, tangible consequence to this action.","Yes"
0,"I have no idea why he entered the country illegal so he shouldn't go to jail, so parole maybe? Find out if he's asylum seeker and go from there.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should not be sent to our prison system. He should be deported back to his home country, again. It is cheaper on the system to deport him each time, rather than house him in the prison system, feeding and clothing him. ","No"
0,"Yes, he should be sent to prison and held there until he can be deported back to his country of origin.","Yes"
0,"I believe that instead of incarceration, he should be deported back to the country from which he came. In my opinion, it would cost more to incarcerate him than to deport him. ","No"
1,"The previous record, even while short stints still poses a threat to people he engages with because of his personality. Unless he can provide proof that he is undergoing help, then he should spend time in prison.","Yes"
1,"A criminal act requires a reasonable punishment.  This person needs to do time.","Yes"
1,"The person is a chronic offender.  They need to be sentenced in order to stop the crime or deported back to their country.","Yes"
1,"It depends on if he was attempting to commit or intended to commit another crime. If that's the case than yes he should go to prison. If he is only guilty of entering the country illegally it's possible that he was trying to make a change for the better and shouldn't be more severely punished because of his history.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"Someone who has been deported once already and who has a violent history should serve some time in prison because otherwise there is no real deterrent to crossing the border illegally.","Yes"
1,"He committed a crime. He is a repeat offender.","Yes"
0,"This is a very difficult decision for me. I totally understand trying to better you and your familys' life, I without a doubt would  do the exact same thing in a similar circumstance. I think imprisonment is a harsh sentence but think it might help to slow down illegal immigration. The only reason im for the slow down of illegal immigrants, is because i feel like Californians resources are strained to the maximum and this is unsustainable, we cant just let things collapse. For example we were in a very serious water condition here and with global warming its only going to get worse","Yes"
1,"This offender was previously sentenced for a violent crime, so he should not be allowed to remain in the United States. Since this man served two prior sentences before trying to live in the US, the US government should not allow him in.","Yes"
0,"This person should be sent back to his country of origin and told not to enter again unless through the proper channels for immigrants.  He should not serve time in a US prison because that would just be spending tax payer money to keep someone alive who is not our responsibility to take care of.  He should go back to his country.","No"
0,"I don't think it makes sense to put him in prison. It will simply cost us money. Possibly deport him depending on his status","No"
1,"This person should be deported to the home country, not imprisoned in the US. If this person had entered the US illegally, and committed a violent crime, it would have been appropriate to send this person to a US prison.  But this person's only current crime is illegally entering the US, so deportation is the appropriate penalty. ","No"
0,"This is not a violent crime and does not hurt anyone. At most, he should be deported back to his own country. However, I feel that he should be given the opportunity to obtain a legal visa and remain in the country. ","No"
1,"The prisoner had previously been deported because of a violent crime, he illegally re-entered the US.  If his reentry did not involve any type of human trafficking or drug smuggling he should just be expedited removal out of the USA.  He already has a previous order of removal so he should just be removed again. ","Yes"
1,"Re-entering the country unlawfully after previously being deported is a federal crime. I'm torn on the prison part, though, because then we are just spending more money on maintaining that person in this country, so I'm torn between prison time and just being deported with no way of re-entering again legally. We have laws that should be followed and every person who disregards the federal immigration law is a slap in the face to those who have followed the rules and worked hard to be here in a legal way.","Yes"
0,"Deportation is preferable than prison, but if we had some kind of grace period for him to become a citizen and accomplish things like, a job, home, and no conviction record. Our legislature should enact a amnesty period of all illegal and undocumented , giving a time frame to meet conditions, and then start on enforcing the laws that are in place but have been ignored, for all new immigrants. ","No"
1,"Because he is not obeying the laws of this country. If he remains on the street or given probation, he will continue to reoffend. ","Yes"
0,"They shouldn't be sent to prison for a 1st offense.  They should be put in jail, processed and sent back to their country.  It is ILLEGAL to enter the United States.  They committed a crime and should suffer consequences like everyone else.","No"
1,"He entered here illegally, which is a crime. If he had been a citizen breaking the law again he would be sent to prison. He should not have more rights than a legal citizen would have.","Yes"
0,"I don'r believe this offemse requires being arrested. If they attempt it again or had reacted with violence then i could see that warranting an arrest","No"
1,"As he has already served two prison sentences, one for a violent crime, he is a repeat offender.  He returned AFTER being deported so odds are if he is deported again he will just return.  Sending him to prison will at the very least, delay him from returning and, hopefully, get him to turn his life around.","Yes"
0,"I do not think he should be imprisioned, he should be sent back to his county. If we imprison him it's the tax payer paying for him and I do not think that is right.","No"
0,"because he came illegally entering the united states.. he want to know his mistakes","Yes"
1,"No matter your legal status if you do something wrong you should be punished. People have to pay for their crimes.","Yes"
1,"Yes, because he already has been deported once from a violent crime. We should not allow anyone with a criminal history to remain here illegally.","Yes"
0,"He isn't a criminal and just wants to enter the US. The government should just send him back to his country.","No"
1,"He may have prior offenses, but I'm not sure if just throwing him in prison again will make much of a difference. He should be deported again. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"I don't think we should have to pay to house him for such a crime.  He should either apply to stay or be deported.","No"
0,"Sending him to prison is a waste of tax payer money. If he is here illegally then he should be deported.","No"
0,"He didn't do anything to harm others and doesn't seem like a danger to others. He should not be imprisoned.","No"
1,"The man is a violent offender and is a risk to other citizens. He has committed more than one crime that landed him in jail. He should be sent back to his home country and be banned from the US and US territories, tax payer money should not be used to house him in jail.","Yes"
1,"Violent criminals have no real place in society, or at least most of them don't. However, they can be reformed. I think that the government should consider deporting him due to his violent history, and because he entered the country illegally.","Yes"
0,"Someone who enters the US illegally should be returned to their country, not imprisoned in the US. He poses no threat to society.","No"
1,"that would be a waste of tax payer money. pls just deport him","No"
0,"I don't think a person should be put in jail because he came into this country illegally because he should be able to find a home here. My feeling is that we should welcome everyone and so it should not be a crime to come to this country. The US government should not take any action.","No"
0,"Seems like the best choice would be to just deport them. I think they may not try again.","No"
0,"I think he should be required to pay a fine. If he does not then follow legal measures to be in the country he should be deported.","No"
0,"I do not believe entering the United States illegally should be allowed. However, imprisoning the person just means that we will be spending money from the government to hold the person in prison. Instead, the person should likely just be deported.","No"
1,"He should be sent back to his country instead of back into prison. We shouldn't waste money on sending him back to prison within our own country.","No"
0,"He should be fined, but not imprisoned. His being here was wrong but did not hurt anyone and he is not a danger to society.","No"
0,"I don't believe he should be sent to prison. That's extreme for doing something that isn't directly doing harm to anybody.","No"
0,"I believe that if the man is in good standing and pays taxes, he should be given a path to citizenship.  He has not committed any other crimes and the United States should help him become a hard working, law abiding citizen of the country.","No"
1,"This is a repeat violent felon who has illegally entered the US.He should be sent to prison, preferably with a sentence of hard labor","Yes"
1,"This man is dangerous and does not respect our laws, they can't keep him out so put him in prison you can control him there.","Yes"
1,"I think this person should be sent back to their home country. If that's not an option, I would think given the information above, prison should probably be the option. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I believe as a repeat offender he should be deported back,especially as he was arrested for a dangerous crime previously. We should not house him in our prisons we he will be fed and be able to have access to learning.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison and deported again. The nature of one of his crimes, being violent, support that proposed action. ","Yes"
1,"HE should be deported back home. Also, he should have no way to re-enter the country due to this","No"
1,"nice in my life is good","Yes"
1,"The man should not be sent to prison, but I believe he should be sent back to his home country. He already has experienced legal troubles and can be violent at times. ","No"
1,"I have no problems with immigrants, including illegals UNLESS they have a violent past.","Yes"
0,"It is against the law to enter the country without regard to visa requirements. He could ask for asylum if it applies otherwise he is breaking the law and should be deported.","Yes"
1,"Re-entering the country after deportation is a federal felony,","Yes"
1,"He was illegally entering our country and therefore should be punished for it. He has previous offenses. He will probably commit another crime in his life so go ahead and put him in prison.","Yes"
1,"If this offender has entered the country illegally and he has previous arrests, he should be deported.  Since he has already served his time in prison for the previous offenses, all that should be done is to send him back to his country.","Yes"
0,"I don't believe that entering the country illegally is an offense that necessarily warrants arrest. Such cases should be examined on a case by case basis, and people should be considered for visas based on their individual merits. In this case, the person had never been incarcerated, so I don't think it would be fair to imprison him now. ","No"
0,"I think that a prison sentence for illegally entering the USA is way too much of a punishment. Send him back to his own country.  The prisons are over crowded as it is.","No"
0,"He should be detained until which time it is easiest to send him back to what ever country he came from, assuming it is safe to do so. There is no reason to imprison him in our country for trying to seek a life here.","No"
0,"He has no criminal history, and the criminal offense did not endanger others.  He should be deported and barred from reentering the US for a specific time period.  This country has an immigration system in place for a reason, and people need to start learning that they will not benefit from circumventing that system.","No"
0,"I think he shouldn't be sent to prison because A, he has no previous record and B, and more importantly, he committed no serious (or violent) offense here. He was most likely just looking for a better life which we would do also if put in the same situation. I can't really think of a punishment though some kind of deterrent should be in place. I don't agree with prison and I don't see them fining him (he probably doesn't have any money anyway), so maybe banning him from ever entering the country? But that seems a little harsh. So I'm not sure on the punishment but there should be one of some kind.","No"
0,"Prison is not the answer for this crime.  There needs to be either a path to citizenship or deportation.","No"
0,"The law states that what he dis was illegal. Because he has broken the law he should go to jail just like anyone who has broken the law should.","Yes"
1,"He is a law breaker in THIS country, first and foremost. He is also a law breaker in his own country.","Yes"
0,"Why fill up our prisons with people who are here illegally, especially with no other offenses. Deport him to his country. (I know he's probably going to try and enter the US again down the road)","No"
0,"The punishment doesn't fit the crime. If they were going to punish him they could deport him, but he does not need to be treated poorly.","No"
1,"He broke the law multiple times.  We don't need more violent criminals.  How does that make our society any better.","Yes"
0,"I think they will probably be detained long enough awaiting trail and deportation and shouldn't serve any extra incarceration. I do not believe that process of trial and deportation would be instantaneous and I do not think that there needs to be and deterrent of extra jail time awarded if they are already going through the trial of being deported back to their home country.","No"
1,"I think he should be deported again instead of sent to prison. That way we don't waste taxpayer money on housing and feeding for him.","No"
0,"He should be sent back to his native country. He should not be imprisioned on the tax payers dime in the country he illegally entered.","No"
1,"He should be deported again. Criminals should not be allowed to come here illegally. But prison may be a not the right choice, but he should definitely be deported again. Cost should be a factor. Is it more to incarcerate him or deport him again?","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Well, if he's """"convicted of illegally entering the United States"""" I guess they will deport him. I don't think he should be in a U.S. prison. I really don't think of it as a """"big crime"""". I have no say with the government. My votes are pretty meaningless and have no control what the government does.","No"
1,"I believe he should be imprisoned because he has been deported previously and has a record of being a violent criminal. If this person did not have a criminal background, I would look more into why he has been trying to cross in the first place. ","Yes"
1,"They should provide him with a place to live in the US and the funds to do so. They should also provide him with contacts to a rehabilitation center if he wishes to do so for his previous offenses. This is so they can fight discrimination in the justice system.","No"
0,"First the reason for his entering the country should be considered. If it can be shown that it was for reasons such as persecution or harm, then he should perhaps be given asylum--if it was not for reasons like this, then he could possibly be sent back to his country.","No"
1,"He should be required to pay a fine. He should then be required to complete legal measures to be in the country if he wishes to remain.","No"
0,"In this instance, I think that the individual should go to prison until he gets deported back to where he came from. He illegally entered the country, when there are lots of other folks that are doing the process in the right way. Being here illegally is breaking the law-and if someone entered another country illegally, you can bet that they would go to prison in a heartbeat. ","Yes"
1,"I think the person should be deported to his own country. I would consider him a violet offender and maybe a career criminal. We should not waste the resources of a already strained corrections system on someone like him and just hope he will not return.","No"
0,"This person should not be put in Jail or detained without do process.The United States has a legal right to deport him back to his place of origin (though I don't personally agree with that...these matters should be adjudicated on a case by case basis ).","No"
1,"He has been caught before, and one of his previous sentences was for a violent crime. He is not positively contributing to the country and is perpetuating the stereotype against immigrants.","Yes"
0,"We do not know what is her real situation. I have a friend graduated from one of the Ivy league schools, she taught in one universities in USA, her visa was expired just because she waited adjustment from Immigration, that means was not her fault at all, but at the end court called her, she had to be in court for several times before she decided to go home to her native country. Base on what she said, Immigration made tough access for skilled and educated people, they prefer illegal people with children. Therefore, government need to do something to fix this corrupt system.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The person should not be sent to prison, however, they must be removed from the country.  If the person is caught trying to enter illegally again then they should be sent to prison before be removed again.  ","No"
1,"I don't think entering a country illegally should be seen as a serious crime.  His past is a bit sketchy, but that isn't a good reason to send him to prison.","No"
0,"If he's never been imprisoned before, there's very little chance he'll do something here to serve time.  He should be required to get the proper documents and become legal, but certainly not imprisoned, especially if he's trying to have a better life.","No"
1,"They are dangerous. They have also broken the law.","Yes"
0,"I don't think it's fair to send the man to prison, he hasn't done enough to warrant that in my opinion.  I think they should just send him back to his country.","No"
1,"This person should not be placed in prison simply because he is in the country illegally.  Every person in the United States is here illegally because this land belongs to the Native Americans.","No"
1,"If you commit a crime no matter , you should go to prision. If you come fro another country, sent back after you serve your time","Yes"
1,"he should be sent to jail because he entered the country illegally and he had already been deported, he is a violent person so there should be some punishment.","Yes"
1,"I trust the law in this scenario. There are laws in place that are clear. The offender should serve time in prison.","Yes"
0,"Like many people throughout history, he was coming to this country in search for a better life.  I think he should be given a fair chance.","No"
0,"He is here illegally and he knows that this is wrong. He should be imprisoned and sent back to his country because it would warn others.","Yes"
1,"I do not think he should be sent to prison, just deported back to his home country. He already committed a violent crime which caused him to be deported. ","No"
1,"He should be sent back to his country. If that's not possible he should be executed.","No"
1,"This is a complicated issue, because I don't believe anyone should be sent to prison based on illegal immigration, even if they have a criminal history. Usually, I would prefer nothing be done, because I think the immigration laws are preposterous, but I think the most appropriate response (especially considering his criminal past) is to not imprison him, but deport him back to his own country.","No"
0,"The man should not go to prison but sent back to his original country","No"
0,"This man is illegally in the US and should be sent back to his country. Putting him in prison justs add costs that the US has to pay. Send him back.","No"
0,"He should be fined and sent to his home country. He will also receive a 1 year not allowed to enter the US restriction. After that he can apply to come here legally.","No"
0,"The U.S. government should consider the circumstances in which the man illegally entered the country. If he was fleeing war or violence, the U.S. government should be lenient on him.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The person has no previous legal issues.  Why should he be forced into a prison?","No"
0,"The authorities should not detain this man. They should grant amnesty. If this country is truly a country of immigrants (with the exception of the descendents of stolen Africans) then our country should respond with compassion.","No"
1,"Regardless of a persons immigration status they're subject to the laws and punishments of the country they are in.  I would then expect following his criminal sentence his immigration status would be reviewed and he would be deported.","Yes"
0,"Iam conflicted on this issue.  II do't think he should actually go to prision but be deported back.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I think this is the persons multiple offense.  They have had many chances to change their behavior.  Yet, they did not.","Yes"
1,"Given his prior violations, he is trending to be a repeat offender. As a result, I believe that the government should either deport of incarcerate the individual, with the latter probably being the most effective since he is violent and most likely return.","Yes"
0,"I believe immigrants should not be treated as harshly as they are. I do not see trying to enter another country as an offense that deserves time in prison. There certainly needs to be some immigration reform to allow illegal immigrants a future in the United States legally and without harsh consequences.","No"
0,"It seems a ridiculous offense to jail someone for when there are murderers and rapists on the loose. Why should he be put into the overcrowded prison system when he can work and contribute to society?","No"
1,"I think he should because he was already in prison for crimes, and he came into the country ILLEGALLY.","Yes"
0,"This is a crime committed hundreds of times every day. The US border patrol would normally process these people by fingerprinting them, photographing them, and asking a few questions. Then they send them back. Quick and easy. Why should the US fill up our prisons with people like this?","No"
0,"I don't think going to another country or crossing an imaginary line drawn on a map is that big of a deal. I truly don't understand why its SO crucial. I think the US government should provide a path to citizenship if thats the route he would like to take.","No"
1,"It depends on the circumstances of the violent crime. It could be that he was the victim of racist who tried to attack him and he was defending himself. If that were the case, I dont think he should serve time. I don't think he entered to country to cause trouble but to escape the life he had in his home country and try to make a better one","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"Need to know more about him like what his employment history is, whether he had good behavior during his previous prison sentences and in between his crimes. There's not enough information although I am leaning towards imprisonment.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"This man has caused harm to nobody.  He was only doing what he had to do to survive.  Now, if he shot an immigration officer upon illegally entering the country or did something that we consider violent, then yes he should serve time.  We shouldn't punish people for doing what they have to do to keep their family alive. ","No"
0,"I don't believe someone should be imprisoned when they are harming no one. They should be giving option for citizen ship or deported back.","No"
1,"He has prior convictions that show that he's a violent offender, and he has already been deported as a result. I don't think the U.S. government should take any additional action beyond sending him to prison.","Yes"
1,"I don't feel that entering the country illegally is a crime punishable by imprisonment IN the country he is entering into, regardless of background. Since he was caught while entering, I do believe that he should be transported back to his country and turned over to their legal system to be prosecuted in the fashion they deem necessary.","No"
0,"Prison is too harsh a penalty for this crime. It very much depends on the details of the situation as to what exactly should be done. VEry little information is provided in the scenario. Why is he here for instance? Is he some kind of refugee? Was he a victim of poverty in his home country? How has he been spending his time since arriving here? It's very hard for me to answer what should be done w/him without having more info. That said, he should not go to prison or jail, but should be dealt with more leniently as per the exact situation. ","No"
1,"He is an illegal alien plus he has been convicted of serious crimes in the past.  He should serve a prison term in the US than be deported back to his home country.","Yes"
1,"This person is a repeat offender and has no regard for authority or for the law. He should be returned to his home country.","Yes"
1,"This person has committed a violent crime in the past, and re-entered the U.S. illegally after having been deported on a previous occasion.  This person presents a threat to society and should be incarcerated.","Yes"
1,"The man should definitely suffer consequences for his actions. However, whether to send him to prison or deport again should possibly be based on which option uses less of the American tax payers resources.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I think they should probably be deported back to there native country.  I don't know if they should go to prison as it would cause an undue burden on citizens.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should not be sent to prison because the only crime he committed was entering the US illegally. Instead, he should be deported back to his own country. It is not clear what his purpose was for coming here illegally, but sending him back is the proper thing to do.","No"
0,"This man entered the country illegally, breaking the law.  It doesn't matter that he had never committed a crime before.  He knowingly entered the country illegally.","Yes"
0,"There was no victim in the crime. He should b given the opportunity to legally enter.","No"
0,"I grant that what the man did was illegal, however it is not in the same category as so many things like car theft or burglary, etc. I think that we need to weight motives here. The man may have been desperate perhaps because back in his home country he struggled to put bread on the table. ","No"
0,"Because entering the united states illegally should not be a crime.","No"
0,"I think all of his available identification should be recorded in the US.  He should be deported; should he return, his information could be accessed if any action is needed.","No"
1,"he should be sentenced to jail time for illegally entering the country.  then he should be deported.","Yes"
0,"he needs to be taken to jail and wait for deportation - come in to this country illegally you should not have any rights period.","Yes"
1,"He was already deported back to his country and he came back.  I am sure he knew the consequeces of his actions and he should be punished for breaking the law.","Yes"
0,"If it is his first offense he shouldln't be put in prison at all. If anything he should be made to go back home.","No"
1,"If this person was caught doing something illegal, he should be held accountable.  If he is a violent criminal and was caught, there is no reason to give him an easy sentence when there is a 3rd strike policy in the US and this would be his.","Yes"
0,"He should not be sent to prison.  the only crime he committed was entering illegally.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison.  He is a trouble causer that has not learned","Yes"
1,"This person has a past history of being convicted for a violent crime on 2 separate occasions.  The illegal immigration would be his third offense.","Yes"
1,"This person is guilty.  He also has a history.","Yes"
1,"Entering the USA illegally is a crime and this should be enforced.  People can not just walk into the country in front of people who have waited their turn.","Yes"
1,"He has served prison already twice. He should be deported because he obviously cannot follow our country's rules.","Yes"
0,"He should not be sent back to prison but sent back to the country where he legally resides. All illegal immigrants should be sent back to where they belong. Without exception.","No"
0,"The United States should give him a temporary visa. It should be based upon him finding work in the next 90 days and keeping out of trouble with the law.","No"
0,"The government should investigate where the man is from and why he left his home country. If he is fleeing or in danger, he should be allowed to stay. If no danger exists, the U.S. government should send him back to his country and encourage him to apply to come in legally.","No"
1,"It is illegal to enter the country with no paperwork. But, if he spends time in prison, he should not be sent back home, as it would be a double sentence.","Yes"
0,"It was a first time offense, one did not know why he did so. Depending on the reasons, one can make appropriate judgement.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should be sent back to his home country. There is no need to keep him here and pay his expensive prison upkeep if he is not even a citizen.","No"
0,"In respect to the person the US should have one of two options for the man. Option one he is deported back to his country. Option two he is allowed to stay with the proper paperwork after he has serve his mandatory prison sentence for this crime. I'm not saying people should get away with the crime, they should know if they are going to stay here they are one of us and will pay what any other citizen would in this situation. However, they should be given the choice to stay or leave.","No"
0,"This person violated the law.  He broke the rules and did not obey them.","Yes"
0,"It is not that serious of an offense. Especially consider its her first time and nobody was injured.","No"
1,"This person meets 3 strikes criteriaentering the US illegally is a crimewhy would the government ignore the disregard for sovereignty?","Yes"
0,"The us government should repeatedly rape and tase this immigrant. This is the only way it can be assured that he will not commit the crime again.","Yes"
1,"deport this person for being here illegally","Yes"
0,"I think the US government should ask this man why he came to the united states. Based on the time he spent in the US and his reasons the gov't should consider giving him sanctuary or deporting him. I don't think he belongs in jail.","No"
0,"This person should probably be Deported back to their country. It's illegal to enter the country without proper documentation.","Yes"
1,"we he keeps committing crimes.","Yes"
0,"I think the man should be sent back to his country since he came here illegally. Since the man hasn't been incarcerated before I don't think he should be sent to prison.","No"
0,"Prison doesn't fix the problem, the man should be returned to his country if possible.  Prison should be used as a protection for the public from dangerous individuals, and as a type of rehabilitation center for those who have broken the laws of society.  Illegal immigrants usually aren't dangerous or needing redirection, their problems are elsewhere.  ","No"
0,"I don't think they should be sent to prison, jail maybe until they figure out what a reasonable punishment might be. Probably would have to deport him. ","No"
1,"Every person should follow the rules & regulations of all countries. Even he is from another country, it is illegal and morally wrong to enter a different country without legal permission / approval from the authorities. The person stated here is sentenced previously or not is not so important in this event.","Yes"
1,"The man entered the country illegally and he should be deported back to his home country. It is especially important because of his previous crimes.","Yes"
0,"I think he should be sent back home and try to enter legally. Our prisons would need to be huge to hold all people entering illegally.","No"
1,"I believe that this person should serve time in prison for his recent crime, and then be deported to his home country. Due to the severity of one of the previous crimes, I don't think leniency is appropriate.","Yes"
0,"I don't think it is a crime that should be dealt with by sending someone to prison. I think you should be deported.","No"
1,"His only violation in this case is that he was crossing the border illegally. I don't believe crossing the border illegally is a case where prison should be the punishment, regardless of prior criminal record. And so it follows that prison isn't the proper punishment here.","No"
0,"Sending this man to prison is too harsh a punishment. I believe he should meet with an immigration official so he could make a case for staying in the country. His life might be in jeopardy if he returns to his native country, and he should not be sent back.","No"
1,"Illegally entering the United States is not sufficiently severe enough, unless he caused harm to someone or their property in the process and that is what should trigger the prison sentence determination.  He would be tying up a bunk and the prison which is needed for more violent criminals.  Deport him and let his home country handle the expense of his room and board.","No"
0,"He did something illegal and people who do that are punished. One punishment is to go to jail. I'm not saying he should be punished for being from another country but he broke our laws and jail time is how we punish criminals here.","Yes"
0,"I think are prisons are already too crowded, we don't need to add illegal aliens to prisons.  He didn't do anything violent, harm any one, there is no need to imprison him.  He broke the rules by coming in here illegally, so I guess he ought to be returned with instructions on what he needs to do to get in here the right way.","No"
0,"I have a moral objection to imprisoning people for simply entering another country and living an otherwise law-abiding life. I don't think we should punish immigrants. This is a country of immigrants. European settlers immigrated here without the consent of the people native to this land. We shouldn't be hypocrites.","No"
0,"I don't think his actions are criminal enough to go to prison.  I think it is more of a civil issue, and he should be deported , or directed towards the proper procedures that will allow him to enter legally in the future. ","No"
1,"He shouldn't go to prison until he commits a crime on US soil. That does NOT include just crossing the border","No"
1,"He is more than aware that he was already deported once. The fact that he committed a violent crime is irrelevant really. If he has not committed current crimes he should just be deported unless the law states otherwise.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should not be in the country, and he already has prior offenses, one for a violent crime. He poses a threat to the public by being free in our country, and since he has already been deported and gotten back in already, he should be put in prison and then deported again.","Yes"
0,"He did not commit a crime that would pose a danger to anyone. The point of actual imprisonment rather than other punitive methods is to isolate dangerous individuals from society at large.","No"
1,"Because he did something illegal. He broke the law and should pay the penalty.","Yes"
0,"There should be a trial first to determine why he came to the US","No"
1,"'Illegal' means against the law. Yes, if he was breaking the law to enter this country, he should go to jail.","Yes"
1,"He is a criminal who has served time before, and even been deported for violent crime. He does not seem like someone who deserves a 'second chance'.","Yes"
0,"No matter who he is, what background he has. If he did something wrong, he should be charged according to his illegal action. I think if he illegally entered , he should be kept in prison until sent back. and ask for the fees from foreign country.","Yes"
1,"He should be prosecuted because he was doing something illegal, no other reason. Technically, his criminal past makes him more at risk of engaging in criminal behaviors in the future, but he should be prosecuted based on his current offense.","Yes"
0,"Part of the reason that people want illegal criminals to be deported is so American tax money isnt used to support them in peison. If he is not violent, tax money should not be used to imprison him.","No"
0,"I think if someone is so desperate to enter the United States, provided they didn't come for nefarious reasons, they should be allowed an opportunity to be a success here. I actually think the path to citizenship should involve a brief military service. ","No"
0,"The man had no previous offenses.  I believe everyone (if they are coming here for better opportunities) should have the right to come to this country.","No"
0,"I think it's important to look at why the person entered the country in the first place.  We shouldn't punish people for our broken laws and slow systems.","No"
0,"If I were the judge, i would have him deported because he entered the U.S. illegally.","No"
1,"he should be deported once again instead of being kept in prison and using our resources, it does not seem that he will be productive after another prison sentence","No"
0,"She did commit a crime but there could be a legitimate reason as to why she did so. She could be held until her background is checked and carefully monitored as to where bouts and work for so long and required to become a gainful citizen as everyone else.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"If he is an illegal immigrants who was convicted of a violent crime, previously served prison time and was deported, he should once again be deported or at least be given a fair trial. It seems like a waste of tax dollars to lock him up in prison again only to be released and live in the US anyways, unless if upon release he'd be deported, then I'd say prison time is fair. ","No"
1,"I do not know the circumstances of the violent crime. If they have had previous prison sentences, they have done their time. But """"violent crime"""" can mean anything from """"bar fight"""" to """"murder"""", so it's hard to make a judgement based on that alone.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Entering the country illegally is a federal crime. We must uphold standards and prosecute crimes to the level they have been set to.","Yes"
0,"I see distinct difference  between deportation and prison. If he is in the country illegally than he needs to be sent home. This would by default mean that he spends some time behind bars. I do not feel he needs to be sent to prison.","No"
0,"The U.S. government should let the man enroll in the process to become a United States citizen. The government should give him an ultimatum to complete the process by a set time or leave the country.","No"
0,"If they are in the country illegally they should probably go to jail.  They are committing a crime.","Yes"
0,"I believe what he did was illegal, therefore he should be punished in some way. I am not sure that arresting him and putting him in prison is the right answer. I think he should be held, interviewed, and if deemed to not be a threat, provided a way that he can become a citizen. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I am in favor of legal immigration, however those immigrants should not be allowed to enter with past violent crimes.This man should be deported again for his offence","Yes"
1,"They should find out why he's trying to get into the us. Is there is anyway to allow him in legally. Maybe he's just trying to start fresh but was unable to enter the us any other way.","No"
0,"He shouldn't be imprisoned for trying to enter the United States. He should be either sent home, or offered a way to make his entry into the US legal. I think if someone is caught illeglally entering the US, they should be fined if they want to stay and sent home if they can't pay that or don't want to.","No"
1,"We should not spend any more money than we have to. Send him back to his home country the cheapest way possible and be done with him. Society has better things to spend their money on.","No"
1,"The U.S. government should not send this person to prison, but instead deport him again with a recommendation for prison time in his home country. He broke the law by entering the U.S. illegally and deserves to be punished, and his past record indicates that he has a greater risk of repeat offenses than the general population.","Yes"
1,"This person is a repeat criminal.  He has been guilty of violent crime in the past.  He is a danger to any society he is in.","Yes"
1,"he should be punished for his violent crime and lack of regard for other people.","Yes"
0,"She shouldn't. She should only have to pay a fine, since she is not a repeat offender.","No"
0,"Just deport him. No sense filling up our already overcrowded prisons simply for someone coming in the country illegally with no other charges against him.","No"
1,"Send the convict to a hard core prison and let them stay there for their sentence.  Then deport them back to their country of origin.","Yes"
1,"He should serve time until such time that he can be ejected from our soil.  He should then be put on some sort of watch list so that he can not re-enter our land.","Yes"
1,"If this person has been convicted of more than one serious crime, I definitely feel he should be serving time for what he's done. Of course, what the actual crime was depends on time served, but to me it doesn't matter if he's from a different country or not. ","Yes"
1,"Send him back. He's had his chance.","No"
0,"He should be given ample opportunity to understand why he chose to come here illegally.  Was his life in his own country being jeopardized?  I think it is wrong to throw people in prison when there may be a better alternative.","No"
1,"I'm not on the jury. I can't judge","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"He shouldn't be sent to jail, but rather deported. We shouldn't have to pay to house him and feed him while serving time. He should immediately be deported and if he wants to come to our country he should fill out the proper paperwork and go through the proper channels. ","No"
1,"The crime of illegally entering isn't an offense punishable by imprisonment. Unless his previous convictions involved illegally entering the country, I doubt they would be admissible as evidence during this case.","No"
1,"I think this person should be sent to prison, until he can once again be deported. Or have his serve his time, and then deport this individual. ","Yes"
1,"He should be sent to prison because he was already an offender. He does not deserve to come to this country illegally.","Yes"
0,"Because he broke the law, the man needs to be punished. Illegal immigration is against the law and it needs to be regulated for the betterment of our country.","Yes"
0,"I think at worst the man should be deported. Without knowing anything else about the situation, I have no reason to believe that he is a particular threat, and I know many of the people who try to cross the border, at least from the south, are pretty pathetic and jailing them would probably waste valuable resources without helping anyone.","No"
1,"No I don't think he should go to jail, I think the government should send him back to his own country and let them figure out and appropriate way to discipline him.","No"
1,"I do not think that the man should be sent to prison. I think that he should be sent back to his country again rather than being sent to prison.","No"
0,"Should be sent home.  They shouldn't be here","No"
0,"He broke the law. He should be imprisoned until his deportation. This is an illegal act. American citizens are expected to NOT commit illegal acts. Why should non-citizens be permitted to commit illegal acts? They SHOULD NOT. Any other country in the world would imprison and deport this sort of person.","Yes"
1,"I believe that this individual should be immediately deported. Placing him in a jail cell means that tax payers are providing him with lodging and food.","No"
0,"The laws of the land are exactly that. If he had been a model citizen, he should be offered a path towards citizenship if that is what he wants. Otherwise, he should elect to be deported to his home country.","Yes"
0,"His offense was an attempt at a better life, (though why he would want to come here now is beyond me). As far as we no he has not committed any other criminal acts, deport him if that is what's called for, but only that.","No"
1,"I would need more information.  I would interview the person face-to-face to make the best judgement.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He has a history of a being violent and was in prision before.  Past behavior is indicative of future behavior","Yes"
1,"He is a repeat offender. He  should get the book thrown at him.","Yes"
0,"should consider why he was illegally admitted","No"
1,"Entering the country illegally doesn't require prison time ... he should not be sent to prison because the prisons are terrible in the us, don't rehabilitate prisoners. ","No"
0,"I am into immigration but it should be legal no matter what your political identity is. The man should be educated on how to process legal immigration so that he can enter legally.","Yes"
0,"Non violent offenders should not be imprisoned.  The man should be given the chance to apply for citizenship and then released to mexican officials.  If his application is eventually accepted after being reviewed he should be allowed back in the country.","No"
1,"He has committed too many crimes not to be punished.  After a prison sentence, he should once again be deported.","Yes"
0,"I think any violation of the law comes with risks, and should be punished. The US should either send him to prison or back to his country of origin.","Yes"
0,"I do not think this man should be sent to prison.  He should be expelled from the country and have his record marked so that if he applies for legal immigration it will be noted that he  had previously attempted to enter illegally.","No"
0,"Prison serves no purpose other than costing taxpayers additional money. He should be exported to his other country.","No"
1,"Perpetrator has a history of being a violent offender. Violent offenders have a high recidivism rate to commit more violent crimes.","Yes"
1,"They should just get documentation so that it's in the system and send him back to his country. If he's caught doing it again then put him in prison. If he's already been to prison a couple of times then what's to stop him from doing the same here in America?","No"
1,"The government should imprison him.  After his prison term , he should be deported.","Yes"
1,"He has shown no regard to the laws of the country. Plus he was convitprior of a violent crime.","Yes"
0,"If their only crime is entering the country illegally, then they should be deported, not arrested. That would just be extra costs in the jail system to house them.","No"
0,"Sending him to prison would be overkill when the only crime he committed has a very simple solution - just send him back. It is very expensive to incarcerate people and he doesn't deserve that kind of punitive measure. I would send him back to the country he came from, and then if he is caught again, we can discuss jail time prior to deportation.","No"
1,"This person really should be deported as well, in my opinion.  This person is a violent criminal who has shown that he is not attempting to make a positive life for himself or contribute to the overall good of society, and instead is intent on being a criminal.  ","Yes"
1,"I believe he should be sent back to prison because he has a history of violent crime. Removal from the country didn't prevent him from returning, he should be re-incarcerated based on that history. The additional crime of re-entering the country illegally should add to the amount of time that he's required to serve.","Yes"
0,"He should be deported.  This would be the simplest resolution.","No"
0,"I think this man should be deported to his home country.  He broke the law and must pay.","No"
0,"It would be a stupid use of resources to imprison them, outrageously costly.  My understanding is that it's simply a misdemeanor anyway.  Also, we need more young workers in the system to continue paying for social security so we should be welcoming immigrants, not imprisoning them.","No"
1,"This person was a repeat offender so we do not want him in our country. As long as he did not commit a crime in our country we have nothing to convict him for and he should be deported.","Yes"
0,"The person hasn't been a violent criminal. They should be returned to their own country and let their government decide what, if any, punishment he should receive. ","No"
0,"Being that this man has no prior offenses he should serve a minimal sentence, however he did still break the law.  Once his sentence is complete this person should be deported back to his country of origin.  ","Yes"
1,"He is of a criminal element that, regardless of his nation of origin, poses a threat to citizens","Yes"
0,"I think sending him to prison will only turn him into a criminal. Instead, the government should give him a path to becoming a US citizen within a certain time frame. If he does not comply, he should be deported.","No"
0,"If that person did not enter the country through established means one might argue that the first order would necessarily be to determine why/how he was in the country. If they illegally entered the country, the first issue would be to return them to their country of origin and suggest corrective action for the home country.","No"
0,"I don't think this person should be sent to prison if he hasn't committed any other crimes. I do think he should be sent back to his own country.","No"
1,"He has past criminal behavior and a history of violence. I think he should be sent back to his own country with a warning that coming back will result in prison time.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"i feel that the government should send him back or help to become a citizen.","Yes"
0,"He committed a crime so yes he should be punished for it. He should have a bond to be released on like anyone else would and sent on his way back to his country.","Yes"
1,"Simply immigrating to the United States should not be a crime. His criminal record is not good, but he has already served time for those offenses. There is nothing stopping him from turning his life around and becoming a productive American. He should not be punished unless he commits actual crimes.","No"
0,"I think prison should be reserved for certain types of criminals.  I don't think that the violations is serious enough to put someone in a prison.","No"
1,"Are you asking if he should be imprisoned for illegally entering the country?  Since your question is not clear to me, I answered I don't know.  If you are asking about imprisonment for illegal entry, I do not think he should be imprisoned here; he should be deported home, assuming he is in no danger if he is returned to his native country.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He definitely should be punished. I waver between imprisoning him here at the expense of taxpayers here, and deporting him to where he came from where he may not be punished, and might even attempt to re-enter the US.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"If the only crime this individual committed was to enter the country illegally and the individual has no previous record in both the US and the county of origin the individual should then be deported back to their country of origin.","No"
0,"if he was here illegally he should just be sent back to where he came from.","No"
1,"He isn't really our problem. We should not arrest him. We should deport him. He should be arrested in his country ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should face whatever the punishment listed for the offense is. He should have been in prison for his original crime.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"The United States has a problem with violence.  People who have been convicted of a violent offense should not be allowed to immigrate to the United States.","Yes"
0,"It depends on the circumstance of this man coming into the country. If he is running from a country in which he is in danger he should not be imprisoned. If he is coming to commit crimes then he should be punished.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I don't have enough information to decide. If he committed a violent crime, that would be enough to warrant prison. But apparently he had already served the sentence for that. Being here illegally itself should not put someone in prison I would think.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"The government should not hesitate to send this person back to their country of origin. Wherever they came from deport them right back because they obviously dont know what america is like","Yes"
1,"With a violent crime in his criminal history, and another prison sentence on top of that, he should at least be judged on this """"third strike"""" of sorts. That's in addition to the crime itself of illegally crossing the border.","Yes"
1,"He's clearly trouble.  He's been arrested before and may continue to violate the law if left out on the streets.  He needs to be apprehended and preferably deported.","Yes"
1,"He broke the law and is a known violent criminal. There is no reason he shouldn't go to prison.","Yes"
0,"He does not have a previous criminal record so he should not be put in jail.  The US government should give the individual a chance to file paperwork to allow him to legally live here.","No"
1,"Since he had already committed crimes before that were violent, the United States government should first send him to prison for 5 years. Afterwards, they should deport him and make sure he does not return.","Yes"
1,"I believe the offender should go to prison at minimum and should also be deported. The offender has broken the law and illegally entered the United States. He also has a violent history, and it would be dangerous to allow him to remain in the general population.","Yes"
0,"I don't think they should go to jail.  I think they should be sent back to their home country.","No"
0,"I don't think entering another country should be a crime. I think he should be allowed a pathway to earn citizenship.","No"
1,"This offender should be deported again from this country. While I am a proponent of immigrant rights the fact that this man was convicted for a violent crime makes me believe he should not be in the United States. Had he not been convicted of a violent crime I would be in favor him obtaining a work visa to stay in this country, should he desire to work, but his criminal history changes the situation in my estimation.","No"
1,"They should be deported immediately","No"
0,"That is a waste of resources.  Get them out of the country","No"
1,"He broke the law coming into the country after being deported. He will most likely do it again if deported a second time. But our prison system does so little to rehabilitate offenders, so once he gets out, it'll be the same story over again, maybe worse.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I think he should be sent to prison or sent back to his home country. He has shown that he has criminal and violent tendencies, and the safety of the people who are here legally is important.. ","Yes"
1,"They should sent the person back to their country because of their past history.They should also have them pay and taxes they owe.","Yes"
1,"As a violent offender  he may not belong in this country. He should be deported either after a prison term or in lieu of it.","Yes"
0,"He should be sent back to his country of origin. Since it is his first time, that is all the action that needs to be taken. ","No"
0,"they should be sent back to their country and face their justice system whether they pay a fine or do time in prison is up to that system","No"
1,"Well, obviously this person has a record of bad behavior. If this was his first offense then my answer would be very different. However, he is a criminal and he has entered the country illegally, so he should stand trial and go to jail. Alternately, he could just be deported, so our tax dollars wouldn't be paying for him to live. however, there's no guarantee he won't try to enter again.","Yes"
0,"The US should help him takes steps to build a life here. He has never been convicted of a crime and would be a good addition to our economy and workforce. Every person deserves an equal opportunity to build a happy life.","No"
0,"with all of the """"exceptional america"""", """"anyone can get rich"""" propaganda this country throws out(not exactly the truth since we are no longer exceptional(literacy, happiness, health care), and the fact some people are actually taking us backwards........who can blame these people for trying? And,  if we are talking about people from south america, it is our interference and OUR drug war that is making the area dangerous and poor and people dont want to live there! We shpould welcome them with open arms since we made a mess of their country!! I dont think we should do anything to some of these people. Especially if they have been here for awhile, certainly not prison!!!! ","No"
0,"I think the police should collect information on the man. I think they should confirm the truth of that information. I think they should direct the man to methods of gaining citizenship. I think they should arrange for him to follow up with them. I think they should tell him that if he does not follow up he will be automatically sent out of the country the next time he is picked up. If he does follow up they will work with him to allow him to stay in the country.","No"
0,"Sending this individual to prison is costly and does not help our society at all. By working with this individual to help him obtain a correct legal status will enable this individual to pay taxes and be a productive resident. If he is sent to jail the country will lose money; if we allow him to work and pay taxes he makes money for the government.","No"
1,"One of these previous sentences was for a violent crime and he had been deported back to his home country.","No"
1,"The person should be arrested for violation of federal immigration laws.  They should have to face a sentence in jail of 6 months to 1 year at hard labor. After serving their sentence they should be instantly deported back to their own country with the knowledge that if they offend again they face a 10 year minimum sentence before deportation, and if again after that term it is life at hard labor with no parole.","Yes"
1,"The person should be jailed. he is a repeat offender who is dangerous and needs to be locked up for a couple of years.","Yes"
1,"He's a prior offender who should have learned his lesson by now. Having been convicted of a violent crime he's clearly demonstrated that he's a threat to society. After he serves his sentence he should be deported back to his home country.","Yes"
0,"I think he should be sent back to his home country. Sending him to prison would not do anything except keep him in America and we would have to pay for his time in prison.","No"
1,"Clearly, this is a dangerous person with repeated violent behavior.  He should be sent to prison and deported to his country by all means.","Yes"
0,"I do not think that this person should be sent to prison.  I think that this person should be sent back to their home country since they are not a citizen of the United States.","No"
1,"This isn't that big of a deal. Just let it go.","No"
1,"I don't think it should matter too much. I don't really care about immigration. It's not jobs I want personally.","No"
1,"i answered that i don't know, because """"violent crime"""" is an umbrella term that can be used to describe anything.  what if he was defending his sister against a rapist and he was the one who was punished?  what if he was frequently bullied and decided to stand up for himself?  the U.S. government should take a close look at the precise factors of his history before making a decision.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Given the offender apparently has no criminal history, the U.S. government should not send him to prison. They should have him do community service or have a low bail if they intend to send him to prison.","No"
1,"He is a rock to society. He committed a violent crime and serve his time. He then showed no remorse and no new higher level respect for the US laws.","Yes"
0,"The US government should consider why this man entered the country illegally, and provide a path to legalization.","No"
0,"I think that he should have to pay a fine.  The immigration system in the US is now setting up immigrants to fail.  They make it very difficult for people to come here legally to work.","No"
0,"He is a citizen of another country so we should just send him back to that country with a warning that he may no longer enter the US. Prison sounds like too harsh of a punishment when he didn't really harm anyone.","No"
0,"I do not believe that he should be put in jail. Yes he came illegally but he committed no other offense. He has never been in jail and is is to harsh of  a sentence, simple for wanting to improve his life and that of his family.","No"
0,"No illegal immigrants should be in this country because they are not citizens. They are also likely to commit further crimes which could be prevented by arresting them.","Yes"
0,"While I do take illegal immigration seriously, I do not think based on their previous record that being sent to prison is really necessary. I think they should either be immediately forced to take the American citizenship test or sent back to their home country.","No"
0,"There should be some form of punishment, perhaps a fine or community service and a requirement and opportunity to apply for a green card.","No"
1,"He has priar arrests, which to me make me believe that he is not going to obey the law any time soon.  He needs to do prison time to show that we will not tolerate laws being broken.","Yes"
1,"If someone commits a crime they must be punished or its worthless to have laws in the first place. The government should lock them up for a time, then deport them again, or figure out a way to fix immigration so that people are able to figure out a way to come here legally.","Yes"
1,"They should hold this person in a detention center for a while. After that they should deport him and inform the police in the area he will be sent to about his prison record. If he returns, he should be locked up again.","Yes"
1,"If he breaks the law in our country then he should have to serve the punishment tht fits the crime. Just because you break a law does not make it excusable to be sent back to your country. You should serve your time and afterwoards be immediately sent back to your own country.","Yes"
1,"This man should be sent to prison. He has broken the law by entering the U.S. illegally - after having been deported once before to his home country - and he has a record of being a violent offender. He needs to be kept away from the public.","Yes"
1,"the usa should make him become a us citizen after reviewing his background and criminal history. if that is clear, they should then make him go through the process of getting a green card","No"
0,"I'd rather reserve the prisons for people who cause harm.  I don't believe that applies here.","No"
0,"I think that they should educate this guy forcibly about the correct way to enter the country and then deport him. If he should return the wrong way again for any reason then he should continue to be deported after a short but ever increasing prison term.","No"
0,"I believe illegal immigration is a victimless crime, he hasn't hurt anyone simply by coming to the United States. However, he is not a citizen and so should not be put through the judicial system. He should simply be deported back to his country of residence or sent to his countries embassy in the US for removal by them.","No"
0,"He should just be sent back to where he came from.  He has no prior crimes, so he is not a criminal, just someone who made a wrong, possibly desperate choice. ","No"
0,"If he had never been in trouble before, I would support simply deporting him.  If it was a 2nd offense, then I would support some prison time before deporting him.","No"
1,"Unless he is committing another violent offense, I do not think he deserves to go to jail.","No"
0,"With no record, I think this person should be sent back to the country he came. I do not think he should be penalised with any jail time.","No"
1,"He came into this country illegally and he had previous violent crimes on his record. Tell me why he should NOT go to prison.","Yes"
1,"This man appears to be disturbed in that he enters this country illegally and commits crimes while here.  I believe this person has a distorted view of how to live in this world and I do not think that he wants help nor does he want to live a law abiding life in the U.S.  He also, appears to be an obvious threat to others. Prison will probably not discourage this individual from entering illegally but a prison sentence might send a stronger message than simply being deported.  He did violate our laws when entering the country without permission.  This person's home country should step up and begin taking responsibility for their citizens and should try to monitor individuals deported back to the home country.","Yes"
1,"He should deport him again.  If he enters the United States again illegally, he should be sentenced to 10 years in prison.  ","Yes"
0,"It is against the law to enter the US illegally.  He should be punished according to the law","Yes"
1,"The man was in the country illegally, even after being convicted twice before. One of the convictions was for a violent crime. ","Yes"
0,"He should not be imprisoned, especially since he has not committed any other crimes. I do believe he should be deported because he illegally entered the country however.","No"
1,"Because of his violent history and because he is an illegal immigrant (key word, illegal), I think he should be deported back to his home country, and not sent to prison here.  We don't need to spend any more money on him in the United States.","No"
0,"because he didn't commit any crimes.he was just trying to be in the united states.","No"
1,"The US government should deport the man back to his home country. If he committed crimes, especially violent ones that harmed innocent lives, it is likely that he will commit them again.","Yes"
1,"I do not think that the man should spend time in prison because he has been deported for his crime. I feel that the U.S government should put this persons name and picture in a database so that he can not come back to the U.S and if he does he will be arrested.","No"
0,"He does not need to be imprisoned. We need some sort of system or fast track to get people who have illegally entered the US permanent residency or citizenship.","No"
0,"HE was convicted of illegally entering the country, his crime was entering the country. Leaving him here only exacerbates that. He should be deported.","No"
1,"This person has ignored the law of our land and committed crimes, one of which was violent in nature. This person should absolutely be sent to prison and then deported.","Yes"
1,"He should be sent to prison because what he did was illegal.  It is not okay to commit a crime and not pay for it.","Yes"
1,"The person has a record already, and has been in prison before. This person should be deported. ","Yes"
1,"He was already convicted of two offenses one of them violent. He is a danger to society","Yes"
1,"He is a repeat offender with fairly bad crimes so he deserves to be thrown into prison. He was also a violent offender which makes the prison sentence all the more necessary.","Yes"
0,"Wasting tax payers dollars to send him to jail.Just use that money and deport him.","No"
0,"I don't think that entering the country illegally is a criminal offense. People flee poverty and violence in their countries out of desperation. Many don't have the choice to come legally. Others can't wait 15-20 years when they are starving or being threatened by gangs.","No"
0,"Coming to a country without having had previous criminal convictions does not, in my opinion, indicate that the man should be sent to prison. The U.S. government should give him a chance to be able to become a U.S. citizen legally, given that he follow all the steps to achieve citizenship.","No"
1,"I am of the belief that opportunities should be given to those from different countries who want to make a better life for themselves in the United States. However, i also believe that these people should only be given 1 chance to prove that they will positively contribute to the community. If an immigrant has been here before and has a violent criminal past i do not think they should be offered another chance. Therefore, i do feel that, like any other criminal, this person should be placed in prison or deported again.","Yes"
0,"They should be deported humanely or offered a path to citizenship. He can't possibly be a contribution to society while in prison. He inevitably will, in fact, be a financial and logistical burden","No"
0,"This is not a crime worthy of putting someone in prison.  There's nothing violent and he did nothing to harm anyone else.","No"
1,"This person broke a law so that means they should be punished accordingly. Despite this person's history, this individual did something illegal and as with anyone else, they must serve the applicable sentence for the crime.","Yes"
0,"I believe he should be sent to prison because he entered the United States ILLEGALY. He should be sent back to his home country and thrown in their prison.","Yes"
0,"Because he clearly broke the law.","Yes"
1,"I think he should be imprisoned for entering illegally. However, I also think that the U.S government should work with him to legally have him enter the U.S. through the correct processes.","No"
1,"I do not believe prison would help him, he should be treated like a human being rather than an animal.    Why continue to make money off peoples suffering through prisons?","No"
1,"The man should not be sent to prison. Instead, he should not be allowed to enter the United States and should be deported back to his country. ","No"
1,"He has been guilty of a violent crime. He has been to prison before.","Yes"
1,"Due to the person's background of criminal activity, they should be held in prison while the motions are made to deport them back to their own country.  If the person had entered the country following legal protocol, the recommendation might be different. ","Yes"
0,"U.S. tax dollars should not be spent imprisoning this man. He should be sent back to where he came and disallowed from entering the country.","No"
0,"He should only be returned home because the crime is not that bad. He should be free because he didn't hurt anyone","No"
1,"I understand why people try to come here illegally, but I also understand why people would not want violent criminals. Past violent criminal records should be taken into account.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"Prison wouldn't help this individual or deter him from trying to enter the US (clearly it hasn't in the past). It would also cost taxpayers less if the government took just about any other action, so I would like to know the alternatives. I would also want to know the details of his violent crime before making a decision.","No"
0,"Even though he was caught trying to illegally enter the country, he's a citizen of another country, and the US government should have him sent back to his home country to determine what the punishment, if any, should be. He didn't try to harm anyone, although what he did was wrong.","No"
1,"No, he should be sent back to his own home country. There is no reason for our government to pay for his survival, that should rest on his own country.","No"
1,"He has committed crimes in the past, and it is apparent that he is not learning. If the government permits it, it is only going to become worse and worse. I do believe he needs to be punished by being incarcerated.","Yes"
1,"He shouldn't be sent to a prison in the US. He should be deported and let the man's country decide what to do with him.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"I think that it is important to figure out the reason for this man to be entering the country.  Was he planning on entering the country and not leaving? Does he have family in the country? Did he not file paperwork properly? How was he caught entering the country?","No"
0,"He should serve a prison sentence.  He should then be deported and prohibited from entered the United States again.","Yes"
1,"He should be returned to his home country without any option to return to the US. We do not need to fill our prisons with convicted felons from other countries.","No"
0,"This person should not be put in prison. He should be sent back to the country he came from and needs to come to this country legally.","No"
0,"Our prisons are already full of people convicted of violent crimes and other serious offenses. I see nothing to be gained by putting this man in with them. I would put a tracking device on him until an evaluation can be made regarding his qualifications to remain in the country.","No"
1,"I don't think that someone having a previous record should mean they go to jail if caught entering illegally. I'm not sure I agree with anyone being jailed for illegal immigration unless they're running a drug trafficking or sex trafficking ring.","No"
0,"I think that the U.S. Government should imprison the person who entered the country illegally for a short period of time, such as one month, and then deport him back to his country of origin.  If he wants to return, he should try to enter legally.","Yes"
0,"Because the punishment doesn't fit the crime. It's too severe. He hasn't harmed anyone, he's seeking a better life. How could anyone justify jail time for that offense?The US government should require that once he's here, he must become an official citizen and follow our laws and be a contributing member of society.","No"
1,"He is a repeat offender and has a past violent crime. In addition, he did not enter through legal channels.","Yes"
0,"Most likely this person is just trying to flee a bad situation in hopes for better life. He should be given a process to follow and become citizen.","No"
0,"One offense with no priors would not dictate that the person should serve time","No"
0,"I  believe this person was likely trying to make a better life.  I don't think society should shun people for that reason.","No"
1,"The offender should be imprisoned because he has a history of violent crime already. Perhaps the government should even consider deporting him again considering that troubling history.","Yes"
0,"This man should not be sent to prison because he is not a criminal. He has done nothing wrong he is just trying to have a better life in America.","No"
0,"My first answer is no, but it also depends on why he illegally entered the U.S. If he committed a crime and fled to the U.S. then yes he should. If he came here for a better life, then I think that is something to be commended rather than punished. The people who would go that far to get better in life show hard work and dedication which America is supposed to be founded on. If I was a business owner, that is a man I would hire because he would strive for the best to keep his job because it meant a better life for him. ","No"
0,"This man should not be impriosined , but should be deported.  She does not have a past record, but is illeagle in this country. ","No"
1,"He has been to prison twice and still hasn't learned his lesson. On top of that, he illegally entered the United States, and is capable of violent acts that could harm innocent Americans. Wit these things in mind, I think he should be put in prison, and for a long time.","Yes"
1,"I don't really know. I mean it's bad, so it's tough to say.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"It's a victimless crime. People who enter the US legally have to pay a large fee, however, so he should be required to pay more than they do.","No"
0,"Imprisonment does nothing to deter people entering the country illegally. It only causes expense for the community and indoctrinates criminals into worse behaviors.","No"
0,"No, the man took great pains to get here and prior to this incident was a good citizen of the foreign country. Give him a warning and send him back.","No"
0,"I do not think that the person should have to go to prison. Mayby they should just be sent back to thier country.","No"
1,"He has a history of violent crime - one of two previous crimes - and was deported back to his home country as a result.  This shows that he is not a model or ideal citizen, and is not the type of immigrant the country needs.","Yes"
0,"I don't think he should serve time in prison. America is the country of immigrants, it's how most of us got here. I think he should enter the country legally. I think authorities should have a further look into his records - see if he has had a job, is contributing to the country's well being and his own well being and tell him to obtain a visa or apply for citizenship.","No"
0,"I don't think he should be sent to jail. If he has legitimate reasons for leaving his country and coming to America (refugee), then those need to be looked at. At worst, he should be sent home to his country but not jailed.","No"
1,"This person should serve at least 5 years in jail. Has prior offenses. Does not deserve a light sentence.","Yes"
0,"The person broke the law and deserves to be punished. They should be sent to jail so as to uphold the law.","Yes"
0,"I think the man should just be sent back to the country of his citizenship, where he came from. I don't think that he should be placed in jail because he was just seeking a better life for himself","No"
0,"They should investigate and find out why he entered the country. If he was only trying to start a life and take care of his family, he should be given the opportunity to do so. There should be routes for people, who are not causing harm, to work towards legal status.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"I do not believe that entering a country should be a punishable offense, nor do I consider entering a country others don't want you to enter to be morally wrong.","No"
1,"I am not certain whether or not the U.S. government should send this person to prison. On one hand, his prior 2 prison sentences are very alarming and gives me pause. On the other hand, I am not sure what the ramifications are for someone illegally entering the country. And I am not sure if a person's previous sentences should at all affect this particular crime.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"Yes, I believe this man should go to prison, because he is a prior violent offender. He was previously convicted and served time in prison, and was deported back to his country.  He should go to prison again, because he did not learn any lessons yet to reform his behavior to stop disobeying the law.","Yes"
1,"He should either be sent back home or to prison. He has committed violent crimes. Anyone else that we're a citizen would be in prison. If he wants to be in this country he has to follow the rules.","Yes"
1,"i think he should be deported. because he has a history plus he entered the us illegally .","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"I do not believe this man should be imprisoned.  I believe he should be deported again, since he had previously been convicted of a violent crime and deported.  I don't believe given these sorts of circumstances he should be allowed to remain unless he enters legally given his background.","No"
1,"I don't think the government doesn't even know what to do. How does he keep getting back into the country without the government knowing?  Somehow there has to be something in place that sets off maybe electronically that he is back in the country. Maybe have names stored in a system who have illegally come into the country and served crimes to be arrested and then sent back?","Yes"
0,"The man is really just an undocumented immigrant and hasn't really committed a crime that is punishable by prison. Perhaps the man should be detained and talked to in case he needs medical attention or counseling, is the victim of tyranny or qualifies for asylum in any way. If the man is an alleged criminal etc. than the possibility of extradition should be investigated, but only carried out if that is the best option and doesn't in fact violate any human rights. ","No"
0,"We should just send him back to his former country. It costs a lot of money to feed and house people in prison.","No"
1,"Prison would be the first step for this person, but ultimately deportation would be the answer. US taxes should not be spent to keep him in a US prison, so keeping him in prison should be less than one year.","Yes"
1,"the taxpayers would be paying for his stay in prison, so it's not a viable option. It would be better for him to be deported in my opinion.","No"
1,"In this case, he was in prison for a violent offense. I think in cases of violent offenses they should serve prison time and then be deported from the country","Yes"
0,"I feel this person should be sent back to his own country.  I do not know of any punishment that would improve the situation.  If we imprison him in this country, we would have to accommodate him and pay for his food and essentials.  I feel that would cost far more than the cost of deporting him back to his country.","No"
0," illegally entering the United States. Prior to this offense, he had never been imprisoned before. they show they are going this.","Yes"
0,"I don't believe he should be sent to prison because he didn't harm anyone or anything. I think he should just be deported back with a warning and held accountable for the next time he's caught.","No"
1,"I am concerned that this person has been deported in the past and has again entered the country illegally. He was previously convicted of a violent crime which warrants a deportation. Disobeying that order is similar to violating parole and so they should go back to prison.","Yes"
1,"I believe he should be sent to prison. Mostly due to his violent past and the U.S government should crack down on illegal immigrants committing crimes in our county. They should imprison him because if they deport him his past shows he will come back and commit more violent crimes.","Yes"
1,"This person should be deported back to his own country by the U.S. government. The taxpayers should not pay to house this person in a U.S. prison.","No"
0,"He has no criminal record that makes him dangerous to others. It seems like the best alternative is to set him on a path toward legal immigration - or at the most deport him (which I would not recommend).","No"
0,"If caught, this person should not receive jail time for a first offense. He should be sent back to the country he came from.","No"
1,"He comitted crimes that harmed people in the US.without entering legally. He should serve his time here and then be deported to his home country.","Yes"
0,"I don't personally believe that something immoral or worthy of punishment has been committed. I think prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for this particular crime.","No"
1,"i do not think that illegally entering the country is an offense that deserves a prison sentence. even though he had a violent crime that he committed in the past, he did not commit a violent crime in this offense.","No"
1,"I think I would like more information before making that decision. Some more detail on his situation.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should be sent to his home country for prosecution. No reason taxpayers should foot the bill when he is another Nation's problem.","No"
1,"U.S. government should enforce laws irrespective of who committed a crime. It especially true for repeated offenders.","Yes"
1,"Since he was convicted of entering the US Illegally he should serve jail time. Even if it is jail time in his country for coming to our country illegally","Yes"
0,"He hasn't really done much at all yet. Just send him back to wherever he came from. Simple and easy. Maybe give him some information as to how to enter legally also.","No"
1,"He should be deported back to his home country rather than the United States taxpayers pay for having him incarcerated. People against immigration are always saying they illegal immigrants get free services; well, this is one case where it would be true, prison isn't free.","No"
0,"",""
1,"I said yes because he had served two prison sentences. Especially, since one of the prison terms was for a violent crime. Since he was previously deported and the violent crime, he has no respect for our laws and our legal system. He will most likely be a recurrent offender.","Yes"
0,"The government should arrest him and send him back. He should be given information about how to enter to country legally.","Yes"
0,"He made a simple mistake. He has learned from his mistake. Make him aware of the crime and let him know that the second time he will be imprisoned","No"
0,"He is not violent or a threat to society, but simply immigrated illegally. The U.S. should either deport him and ensure he is safe where he will be or help to set him up to be a productive citizen.","No"
0,"His crime is entering the country illegally but he does not have any other offenses. American prisons are already overcrowded with people who do not deserve to be in prison. This man should be deported to his own country and advised to attempt to the country legally.","No"
1,"Since he is a repeat offender I think he needs to be punished pretty severely this time. His previous violent crime is very concerning as well. Since he been deported and returned illegally I think it would be better to send him to prison.","Yes"
1,"Coming here illegally isn't a jailable offense. I think he should be deported again. If he comes back and then commits a violent crime, he should be prosecuted for that.","No"
0,"I feel the man should not serve prison time as he has no prior convictions and wasn't harming anybody. He doesn't seem violent or a threat to society. What I would advise is that he is issued a warning and given the chance to begin proceedings to legally obtain residency. If punishment is given I would suggest some sort of fine and warning.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison because he was convicted of a crime, and obviously deportation didn't keep him out of the US. Also, he is a violent criminal and should be incarcerated, not simply deported.","Yes"
1,"He not only came illegally to the United states, thereby skipping everyone who is trying to enter legally. Not to mention he has been deported before after he committed a crime and spent time in jail.  If he wanted to come to america do it legally and don't be a criminial. ","Yes"
0,"I think that he should not be put in jail/prision unless he is known to be a terrorist, ect that could bring harm to our country. If he is not known other than just a good citizen from another country he should be givent he chance to enter our country legally, if he should need the help to do it legally I think he should be given the help to do so, in the mean time he could be registered under """"temperary status"""" and his whereabouts monitored until he can become legal to be in this country.","No"
1,"he is a violent criminal that has prior offenses. And he knew what he was doing was wrong","Yes"
1,"He should be sent to prison because it is a federal offense to illegally enter this country. Additionally, he already has a prison record so he is a repeat, at risk offender. His nationality has nothing to do with this. It is simply the fact that he committed a felony, and is already a convicted felon","Yes"
0,"I don't believe that this person should be imprisoned. Instead, he should be warned to follow legal immigration procedures and deported to his country of origin. ","No"
1,"His past offenses were violent. He's unsafe and should be off the streets.","Yes"
1,"The offender has served his time for his previous crimes.  He should be deported back to his country for the illegal entry but not imprisoned.","No"
1,"The person must serve jail time for violation of the U.S. law. And he should be deported after serving for living in the U.S. illegally.","Yes"
1,"He is a habitual offender. He has twice entered illegally and has twice been imprisoned. He should be deported.","Yes"
1,"Due to man having a previous history with a violent crime, it is possible that he could commit another violent crime.  If he did not have any previous criminal history, then the U.S. government should consider his intentions in the United States and possibly consider his eligibility for VISA status.","Yes"
1,"If we are deporting him, we should let his country decide. We should definitly work with them, but since it's not our citizen, it's a not a unilateral decision on our part.","No"
1,"The U.S. government should send this man to prison due to his previous record as a criminal. They should not allow him leniency because of his status as an illegal immigrant.","Yes"
0,"An immigrant should not be sent to prison for illegally entering the United States if they have not done anything else illegal.  The government can deport these immigrants if they feel the need too but it is probably not worth it if the immigrant is acting as a respectable citizen.","No"
0,"I don't think he should be imprisoned for entering illegally; he should be deported back to his home country though. I just don't think the crime is serious enough to warrant a prison sentence.","No"
0,"Imprisonment is unnecessary as he is not a threat. If anything, he should be deported but that also depends on the situation. Most likely he is here illegally for a better life which in that case, he came out of desperation and should be able to go through the process of becoming legal.","No"
0,"He has been to prison twice before he is a danger to society","Yes"
0,"Why should we pay for prison. Deport him, it's cheaper.","No"
1,"The government should enforce a stricter punishment because it has been proven that this man is not only dangerous but he is a repeat offender. This person most likely has no respect for American laws and rules.","Yes"
0,"He tried to enter the country with no criminal record. Just because he is not a legal entrant does not mean he should get prison time.","No"
1,"He should simply be deported with a suspended sentence. If he returns illegally, he should serve the sentence.","No"
0,"person entered the country illegally and should be placed in jail and then quickly deported back to his country of origin. He is not a citizen of the US and does not have any rights of citizens in the US. He should then not be allowed to enter the US in the future unless receiving prior authorization from the government.","Yes"
0,"He should be sent back to his home country, any illegally obtained U.S. property seized, and he should cautioned that if it happens again he will have to serve a significant period of time in prison.","No"
0,"I think they should because it would sent a message to others trying to enter the U.S illegal. I also think they should make the prison sentence very short and after that just send him back to his country.","Yes"
0,"We should just send him back. He broke the immigration law but the penalty for that should be removal from the country, not jail time. Because we would probably just send them back after they were in jail, so why spend the tax dollars and fill our jails up more?","No"
0,"I don't think he deserves prison time for entering the U.S. illegally. I do think he should be sent back to his country though.  There is no need to clog up our already full prisons with an illegal immigrant.","No"
0,"I don't believe that someone trying to get into the country looking for opportunity should be punished especially if they have no criminal history. I believe they should be fined and be given information about a path to legal citizenship.","No"
1,"This person should be deported immediately. They are a violent criminal and are not contributing to society in a positive way.","Yes"
0,"I think that there are many good reasons people enter our country illegally and each case needs to be reviewed independently.  If he has no previous record, I dont' think he should automatically be imprisoned","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"He broke the law, it doesn't matter why he entered the county illegally, he still broke the law. We don't what his intentions for entering illegally are, they could have been negative.","Yes"
0,"Since the young man has no prior offenses and had never been imprisoned before, I think that he should be deported and encouraged to enter the U.S. legally. He should also be given a warning that if he tries to re-enter the U.S. illegally again, he will face imprisonment.","No"
1,"They have proven themselves incapable of following the law.  They should be deported once again.","Yes"
1,"crossing the border isnt a violent crime. send him back to his country. we dont need him here","No"
0,"Since he is not a citizen of the United States he should not be placed in the prison system. The man should be deported back to his own country, with no chance of return with a visa etc.","No"
1,"I don't think illegally entering a country should merit prison time (unless you are an egregious offender, I suppose). His past criminal history is somewhat troubling, but at a glance does not seem serious enough to hold against him for this more recent transgression.","No"
0,"Check to see if he is a political refugee. If he is, he can stay. If not, mug shots, prints, facial recognition and a warning that if he comes back he will be chipped.If he remove s the chip and comes back, he gets a tattoo right across his forehead. If he comes back after that, it's jail time in the arctic.","No"
0,"this person should be deported immediately.  he is here illegally therefore he must leave.","Yes"
1,"Anyone breaking the law should serve their sentence.  However, those who knowingly committed crimes in the US and are illegal from from other countries, should be deported.  If they continue to come here illegally, lock them up.","Yes"
1,"First the offender entered the United States illegally which is a crime. He had already served prison time for a violent crime and was deported. He then came back illegally again. He obviously didn't learn his lesson and needs to serve a longer sentence.","Yes"
0,"If he goes to prison, then he is more of a drain on the US resources than if he was given a way to become a citizen and integrate into the community. He doesn't have a criminal background and is motivated to improve his life and circumstances.","No"
0,"What was his reason for entering the country illegally? And what is his intent of entering the U.S.?","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"I don't believe that with not having a prior criminal record that he should be imprisoned. However, I so believe he should be sent back to the country that he came from. ","No"
1,"Because he entered illegally and was clearly trying to run from something. Especially if he had already been to prison twice.","Yes"
0,"While he committed a crime, I don't feel it warranted jail time. He should be deported instead.","No"
1,"I think this man should once again be deported from the U.S.  I'm not sure if he should be sent back to prison however as he has already served time.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"It's a crime, but it doesn't really call for prison time for it. I don't believe that he hurt anyone in any way.","No"
1,"It looks as though this man has not learned anything or tried to change his behavior as he has been convicted of a violent charge previously.  Also, he was deported, so he should not have even been in the country.","Yes"
0,"The man shouldn't be jailed but to be deported and barred from entering the United States for at least 3 years. Entering United States illegally is wrong but it is not a crime that warrant jail time like stealing or hurting another person.","No"
0,"Placing the man in prison means that our country would have to pay to feed, clothe and harbor him.  Our government would send the man back to his country of origin, or if refused, back to the country that he immigrated from.  He should be a burden upon another society, not ours.","No"
1,"Doesn't seem reasonable. Overall not a good idea","No"
0,"No reason to put him in prison. He should have to go back to his country unless he can show that there is a reason why he can not go back","No"
1,"He is a repeat offender who didnt learn a lesson","Yes"
1,"The government should jail him and then deport him once his prison sentence has been served.  Either that or force the home country to lock him up for the crimes committed.  Violent offenders and repeat offenders are ticking time bombs.  Statistically repeat offenders are very likely to repeat again and potentially more severe.  The news has shown multiple instances of previous deported violent offenders coming back into the country and then murdering citizens.  Perhaps a chip tracker to detect if they are back in country again?","Yes"
1,"The U.S. government should deport the man and not waste our tax money on him being in prison. We should take all possessions that he owns (homes, cars and personal belongings) and return him to his country of origin with nothing.","No"
1,"I am torn. One one hand I feel that if he was here illegally, then he should possibly be sent back to his place of origin. There isn't a reason to create a burden on our own system to harbor this person. I don't outright say yes though because this looks like a recurring problem, so just jailing him or sending him back may not solve a problem.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"The man should be deported because he entered the country illegally and was convicted of a violent office in the past. Having already served two prison sentences and being caught committing a new crime indicate that there is a high rate of recidivism with him. Allowing him to remain in the country is too big of a liability but I do not think he should be imprisoned as this is not a violent crime.","No"
0,"People come here to have a better life and we shouldn't criminalize people for that. We should send those people back to their countries without imprisonment if we can't figure out a way to allow them in legally.","No"
0,"To the best of my knowledge he has committed no criminal offense, and at most should be detained until his immigration status is confirmed.  If he entered illegally he could be deported, but not imprisoned.","No"
0,"simple for the fact he has not been in jail before. But the U S is resposible for contacting the immigration office about this man. And if deem , he will be sent back to his country. the man country is hold responsible","No"
1,"I believe this person should be deported.  If he has been convicted of a violent crime why is it our problem when he illegally came into this country.","Yes"
1,"I think this man should be sentenced to prison time based off his previous charges and record. He had previously been arrested and sentenced  for domestic violence and was deported back to his home country. With this taken into consideration, he should very well know he is not permitted to be here therefore should be sentenced to prison time for illegally coming back into this country.","Yes"
1,"the person should be forever kicked out of the country.  a country shouldn't have to pay to house this person in their prisons.","No"
0,"I personally think that rather than detaining a man who seems to be dangerous at cost to the taxpayer, he should be deported. No reason to keep him here, ship him away.","No"
0,"Yes, he should. There are proper procedures that are to be followed in order to legally enter the United States. If you don't follow those procedures, then the very first action an immigrant takes in America is illegal, and should be punished.","Yes"
0,"I do not think that is an offense worthy of prison. I think this person should be deported and forbidden from ever becoming a citizen.","No"
0,"according to my point of view this is not a big offense or crime. we have lot of crime other than that to put into prison. this person may be illegally entering into states because of lot of reasons such as poverty, hungry, poor etc.,","No"
1,"I'm unsure of what should happen. This person should be in prison but not in the US. If he is a known violent criminal he should be subject to the prison laws of his own country and not become a tax and healthcare burden on the citizens of the United States.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He should be deported again and serve time in a foreign prison if necessary, but not in the USA.  Tax payers should not have to pay more money for this man who does not belong here.","No"
0,"If he has no criminal record and is not fleeing his own country for committing a crime, then he should be given a way to become a citizen after living and working here for a certain number of years. There should be ways for people to work toward citizenship.","No"
1,"I don't know if prison is the best long term solution. It's the easiest thing to do now, but in order to actually solve the problem the root of the crime needs to be fixed","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The US government should track this individual and ensure that these types of crimes do not keep occurring by the same individuals. Due to no prior offenses, I feel this person should be barred from entering but not charged with a crime unless it occurs a second time.","No"
0,"Rather than prison in the US, he should be sent back.  There are other possible variables that would change my opinion such as length of time in the US, the individual's skillset, whether he's employed, etc.  But as written, it set caught on entry, so send him back.","No"
0,"He shouldn't be sent to prison because he only committed one crime in the country. And since he's not a citizen, he should be deported back to his country. ","No"
0,"Our government has to set an example somewhere showing that it is not okay to enter our country illegally.  There are other ways into our country which are legal.  For the most part people who enter the country illegally should be sent back to their country.","Yes"
1,"The individual has a criminal history. One of his previous arrests and sentences was due to a violent crime. He should be placed in jail and deported back to his country of origin.","Yes"
1,"Well its not his first time breaking the law and that should be taken into account. He has proven he still has litle respect for rules and needs to be held acceptable.","Yes"
1,"He should be sent to prison. Alternately, he should be deported.","Yes"
1,"His behavior is unpredictable. He should be sent back to his country.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He broke the law so he should be deported once again. He should be blocked from ever obtaining citizenship form America. He also has done something violent before and been deported so he knows that this was wrong.","Yes"
1,"Given how the illegal alien has continuously violated U.S. law, the U.S. government should imprison this individual for life, to send a message that violations of immigration law will not be tolerated. The U.S. government should also consider commuting the illegal alien's sentence to another prison in a different foreign country, as a means of ensuring that the home country doesn't simply let one of its own off the hook once the dust settles down.","Yes"
0,"While not sent to prison, he should at least be held in a local jail. Depending on his reasons for entering the US illegally, he may be sent to prison later.","No"
1,"I do believe this person needs to be in prison, but I'm not sure if it should be in the United States. I'd probably feel better if he was deported to his home country and imprisoned there. That way we aren't paying for him to stay in the US.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Put him in prison and get him in line for deportation.  Then at the first opportunity deport him back to where he came from.","Yes"
0,"I think this man should be deported to the country of his citizenship.  I also think he should remain in custody until he is deported.","No"
1,"He's an illegal and alien and a criminal. It's a no brain decision to lock him up!","Yes"
0," Because simply entering this country should not be punishable by detention. You might be able to argue for deportation (But depending on location, he may be in a Sanctuary city and therefore unlikely) but imprisonment is unquestionably out of line and has in the past lead to too many abuse cases for it to be considered a responsible punishment. ","No"
1,"I think the government should send him back to his home country and there he should be put in prison. That way he would not take up any space or tax dollars in the American prison system.","Yes"
1,"It appears that since he has a track record of misconduct already in this country, he should not be allowed on the streets as he is causing more problems than benefits. He is becoming another problem.","Yes"
0,"This person, who entered unlawfully should not necessarily be detained in a US prison unless another crime was committed. He or she should be deported back to his or her country of origin and allow the authorities there to accordingly punish them. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Usually illegal immigrants are refugees and we should make an effort to help and not condemn him. We are in fact a land of immagrints. We need to set the better example of humanity.","No"
1,"I think that he should be deported from the U.S again to hopefully spend time in prison in his home country. I might have felt differently had he not been serving for a violent crime, but unfortunately he did, so I would still deem him dangerous and suggest not allowing him to stay in the U.S.","Yes"
1,"It is violation, but I wanna know why he comes here legally, and what could we do to help him in his situation. What efforts in his homeland or if he can stay here.","No"
0,"He should not be imprisoned because all he did was illegally come into the country. In this case, that punishment does not fit the crime. People shouldn't be imprisoned for every crime they commit, there are other ways to punish someone. He should be sent back to his country.","No"
0,"I do not think this person should be sent to prison.  If this person is a first time offender and their only crime was entering the US illegally, sending them back would be punishment enough. This person has probably already paid a large amount of money and suffered greatly getting here, just send them back with a warning.","No"
0,"why should he be imprisoned when no one got hurt?","No"
1,"He should just be deported.   I think it's extra punishment to sent him to prison too.","No"
0,"The european colonists who came to this country and killed off the native americans entered """"illegally"""". Undocumented immigrants should not be sent to jail but rather provided with options on achieving citizenship or temporary visas. If that is not possible the worst case scenario should be deportation.","No"
1,"He had entered the United States illegally.  He had committed two crimes. One of the crimes a violent crime that he had been deported back to his home.","Yes"
0,"The man should not be imprisoned in the United States, but should be immediately and permanently deported to his home country. Illegal aliens shouldn't be harbored in the United States, even in prison, which is an unnecessary burden on the American taxpayer.","No"
1,"He is here ilegally. He had already been deported once. He had his chance.","Yes"
1,"Really the only punishment for illegally entering the country should be deportation. Why should the country pay to imprison someone who wasn't supposed to be here in the first place.","No"
0,"I don't think he should be in prison. He should be detained and considered for deportation","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The police should just send him to deportation. It doesn't warrant an arrest. So it would be better if he get deported back to his country.","No"
0,"People entering the country illegally should not be imprisoned, but they should be detained and then sent back to their country of origin.  They should be coming here through legal channels.  We cannot just accept everyone who illegally makes it across our border. ","No"
0,"He has committed a crime by crossing the border without permission and should be punished. If they chose not to punish him that would be a signal to other people that they can do the same. Breaking a law is breaking a law no matter where the person is from. If i were to visit Italy and commit a crime, I would expect to be punished there even though I am not a citizen.","Yes"
1,"If prison is the only option then yes, he should go there. he should be sent back to his country.","Yes"
0,"I think the U.S. government should deport this person. This has always been the action we've taken, and it is much cheaper than sending such a person to prison on tax payer dollars.","No"
0,"if he is asking for asylum - he should be not jailed. if he illegal entered the US for nefarious reasons - then he should be jailed","No"
1,"This person should serve prison time because they have history of being deported and serving previous prison sentences. This person it also a violent criminal and they should not be given any sort of leeway.","Yes"
0,"I don't think this person should go to jail because they have never committed an offense before. However I do think that this person should be extradited back to their country of citizenship but be allowed to follow the proper procedures to enter the US","No"
1,"The man should not be sent to prison in this case.  He should be deported back to his home country.","No"
0,"A non-violent offender that has no previous cases of any other offense should not go to jail. Perhaps give a metaphorical slap on the wrist.","No"
1,"He has a history of violence, and we have enough of that in America. History with a violent criminal past and time served. ","Yes"
1,"He was a previous offender for a violent crime which merits some prison time. I think it's possible that he should be deported because he has been in prison twice now and should not be allowed to return to the country","Yes"
0,"Yes, he should be sent to prison for a few weeks and then sent back to his own country.  If I did this in any country that I'm not a citizen of the same thing would happen to me there.","Yes"
1,"He should be deported and penalized  in his home country. Preventions should be taken so that he cannot return back to the US.","Yes"
1,"This offender should be sent back to his home country. The U.S. government should not be responsible for using tax payer money to support this man in prison. If he is caught again, he should be executed.","No"
1,"I really don't know. I'm not really for just putting people in jail because they are here illegally, but I do think if someone commits a violet crime, they should go to jail. But this guy appears to have served his time when he did commit a crime, so to use his past to put him in jail again seems like double jeopardy to me. But at the same time, I don't really want to worry about him committing another crime. But also, I wouldn't put an American in jail because they are speeding and have a past violent crime.  ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He is a violent criminal who will probably commit more crimes. If he is sent back to his home country, he will try to enter the US again. Better to send him to prison here.","Yes"
0,"The most they should do is send him back to where he came from. He should not be sent to prison unless he committed an actual crime that harmed others. he could have had very legitimate reasons for coming over illegally. They should analyze his situation and decide if they should send him back or let him stay.","No"
0,"get ride of them, send them back to their own country and let them puttheir own people in harms way","No"
1,"He has previous criminal offenses and obviously is a serial offender.  Especially the fact that he was convicted of a violent crime.  He will break the law again and should be locked up for the safety of the people. If they deport him he will just come back again.","Yes"
1,"If anything he should be sent to federal prison , he knows what he did was illegal. He had also previously done time for a violent crime, he knew the consequences.","Yes"
0,"The U.S. government should jail this person as well as send him back to his country.Every law is in place to protect the citizens and be fair. It doesn't matter if the person had good intentions but the law is a rule that should be followed.","Yes"
0,"Cost.  Deport instead.Two sentence fragments good enough?  Don't pay for their incarceration AND deportation, just get them a bus ticket and send them back.","No"
0,"At most they should just return him to his country. He did not harm anyone or violate other laws.","No"
0,"He should not be punished.  He should be sent back to home country.","No"
1,"Because this was a violent crime, he should be treated the same as any other person, citizen or non-citizen, that commits a violent crime. The U.S. government should ban him from re-entering the United States with the penalty of imprisonment if he attempted to.","Yes"
1,"He should be imprisoned for disobeying our laws and be punished by being sentenced to jail. Then following his sentence, be deported.","Yes"
1,"He is clearly a repeat offender and continues to enter the US illegally.  I think that he should be sent to prison.  I hate to spend US resources on a repeat offender of another nation, but he keeps coming back and committing crimes.  At least lock him up in the US where he can't keep committing crimes.","Yes"
1,"He shouldn't be sent to prison here because he should be deported again. He shouldn't be allowed remain in the country and take up space in our overcrowded prisons being a burden on our taxpayers.","No"
1,"they should send him back to his country. no prison time because that would be expensive for this country. he should just be deported.","No"
0,"I believe he should not go to prison because if he did not do anything wrong, then he does not deserve a punishment that harsh. If he illegally entered the United States, then he should be given a fine at most, but also get registered as a US citizen as long as long as he has never committed any major crime, which he hasn't as explained.","No"
0,"He should be sent to prison and then deported. A US citizen doing this in another country would get the same treatment.","Yes"
1,"I do not think this person's previous criminal record should impact the government's decision. What happened occurred in the past and has nothing to do with his entering this country illegally. Plus, people enter this country illegally all the time. It is not something that should be punishable via prison time.","No"
0,"He should instead be deported. With as many illegal immigrants entering the country as we have, it is a pretty large financial burden to incarcerate every individual that is in the country illegally. If they continue to come back and get caught, then prison should be considered. ","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison because he is obviously not learning his lesson.  He has already served time in prison and keeps coming back in this country.","Yes"
0,"What did this person do wrong? We're a nation of immigrants we should let people into our country just as we did before. This world is for all of us. There are no real lines that make countries.","No"
0,"Some people just want to get away from their country. It's all about control.","No"
1,"I believe he should serve some prison time. If he was convicted of a violent crime, he might be a habitual offender. We do not need this person running amok in our society. I would recommend parole if he is a model prisoner and then possibly letting him remain in the U.S.","Yes"
1,"Two previous prison sentences. He had been deported back to his home country. He repeats a crime ones he was convicted he shoud go to prison.","Yes"
0,"either deport him or find a way to make him useful some sort of work program ","No"
1,"Becuase the offender already had alot of chances. Also theyre not from this country","Yes"
0,"Confirm he is not doing any current illegal activities and give him a hearing date that the person should show that they are making attempts to get current citizenship otherwise the next time they are caught they will be deported.","No"
1,"He should serve a fairly long prison sentence in the US first as he has entered illegally for the second time and has a violent criminal history.  When he is released he should be sent back to his home country.","Yes"
1,"I don't think people who are caught trying to illegally enter this country should be sent to prison. They should be deported.","No"
0,"","Yes"
1,"If he had not previously been sent to prison for a violent crime I would be a little more lenient. He is not a good person.","Yes"
0,"I think the man should be deported back to his country of origin. We should not need to imprison this individual since he shouldn't be here in the first place.","No"
0,"Imprisoning this man serves no benefit for anyone, and it costs money to incarcerate him that the anti-immigration crowd typically lists as a reason why we shouldn't be letting illegal immigrants in at all.  For immigrants with otherwise no criminal record, there should be a program for citizenship that comes along with a fine or perhaps community service for the initial illegal act.","Yes"
0,"First time offenders should not be imprisoned for things like that. Only serious crimes should receive that sentence.","No"
0,"He should be send back to the country he came from","No"
1,"I believe only serious criminals should go to jail. This person should have to take someeducational course and also have to pay a fine and be on probation for a little while.","No"
0,"I think if it was his first time he should be sent back home with a stern warning not to come back unless he does it legally.  Nobody wins by putting him in jail, especially if he isn't a criminal.   We would have to provide for him if he stays here in jail.  However, if he comes back again illegally, he should serve time in jail and then sent back again. His jail sentence should become longer each time he is caught here.","No"
1,"I don't think being here """"illegally"""" should ever result in prison as a consequence of that. I think he should be sent back to his home country. ","No"
1,"He shouldn't be sent to prison because we would have to pay for it. He should be deported back to where he came from.","No"
0,"Coming into a country is not a crime.  Putting him in prison doesn't do any good.","No"
1,"Because of his prior history of offenses, it shows that he should be placed in prison. Because he has a tendency to be a violent criminal, it would be better if he were behind bars.","Yes"
1,"The person should either be redeported or thrown in prison. They are a menace too society.","Yes"
0,"In my opinion, if you commit a crime then you need to face the consequences. It doesn't matter how clean your past record is (though I do believe this should be taken into account on the severity of the time/punishment). There are many legal ways to enter America and become a citizen. It is unfair to those immigrants if we just allow anyone into our country illegally without consequences. I don't believe we should necessarily send all of the illegal immigrants to prison, but I believe we should send them back to their country unless they are repeat offenders.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"The U.S. government should work to determine the reason for his immigration to the United States.  If he is not coming here for illegal reasons, the U.S. government should reach out to NGOs and help this person settle in the U.S. so that he can become a productive member of society.","No"
1,"This man should serve the time in prison for the crime of breaching the borders of the sovereign country without proper permits.  After that, he should be deported to the country of his citizenship.  The US should implement better protection of its borders.","Yes"
0,"Our prison resources are stretched thin and we must prioritize who should be imprisoned. Only violent offenders, and not non-violent offenders should be imprisoned.","No"
0,"If he hasnt been in trouble before, he shouldnt be excluded from entering the us. i thik if immigrants have no prior offenses theyre welcome","No"
0,"If the man is not a violent offender, he should not be in prison. There are many people why people enter the United States illegally, and it is not all malicious. The government should interview this man to see why he entered the US, and assist him appropriately.","No"
1,"I think he should be sent back to whatever country he came from. Why should the taxpayers have to support him for whatever length of sentence he would be given?","No"
1,"This man is a known violent offender and not a current citizen of this country.  Given this fact, he intentions in the country are not honorable.  I believe the government should jail him or at least deport him back to his home country.","Yes"
1,"He should be deported and not let back into the county.  He should never have been let into the country to begin with.","No"
1,"I do not believe he should be sent to prison on the sole basis of entering the US illegally. I would be indifferent to deportation, but do not think we we should add to overcrowded prisons unless he had committed a more serious offense. ","No"
1,"Given the prior criminal record, the illegal immigrant should be deported immediately. Convicted illegal immigrants are the highest priority for deportation.","Yes"
0,"The current law deals with undocumented people caught within the United States by sending them back to their home country. This type of action just incurs the individual to find another means to cross the border. If on the other hand a person is caught illegally in the U.S. and sent to prison and the financial bill to house them is sent to their home country to where their country would have to pay for their incarceration then maybe some progress can be made in curbing illegal crossings.","Yes"
1,"While the man may have committed a civil violation by entering the country without permission the first time, being deported probably came with stipulations that re-entry was prohibited due to the nature of the crime and deportation proceedings. The government should detain the man again for the crime of illegal reentry, where a sentence of several months is reasonable, before deporting the man again. This could demonstrate that the US will take illegal entry seriously, especially towards felons who try to reenter the country.","Yes"
1,"He should not be put in prison at the taxpayer's expense. Since he is here illegally, he should be deported immediately. ","No"
0,"I think that they should interview him to determine his intentions once he arrived in the country. If he was plotting some sort of attack or intended on committing other serious crimes then he should probably be imprisoned. If he entered the country seeking asylum or looking for a better life for himself/his family then we should do what we can to help him. If he entered the US illegally for any other reason then he should probably be deported back to his home country.","No"
1,"He broke the law. But I think he shoul be deported back to his country.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"Prison is too harsh a punishment. Since he has no previous crimes, the best course of action would be to hold him temporarily in a jail until he is able to be deported.","No"
1,"On the one hand, I think he should be deported to prison in his home country. On the other I think that if he's already gone that route and come back, he should be kept here because our prisons will actually hold him. On the third, I'd rather see people rehabilitated than feed the prison-industrial complex. ","Don‰Ûªt Know"
0,"He should not be sent to prison, but breaking the law does not need to be excused either.  He should be deported and told to enter legally as millions do each year.  If he commits the same crime he should then be given 6 months and deported, with an additional 6 months added each time caught entering illegally after that.","No"
1,"He simply entered the country without permission. I feel this is a non serious offense and he should simply be sent back to his home country.","No"
0,"I don't think he should be sent to prison because this is his first defense and it was not a violent crime. He did break the law and I think he should do at least 60 days in county jail and then be deported.","No"
0,"I don't think he should be sent to prison, but instead deported to his country of citizenship. He is a first time offender and his only crime was illegally entering the country, there is no need to throw him into prison for this offense. The proper recourse should be sending him back to his country.","No"
1,"He should be sent to prison for a longer time but I don't think he should serve that time in the U.S. He should be deported again.","Yes"
1,"The punishment for illegally entering a country should be so severe that it deters any one else from even considering it. He should be punished to the extent of the law regardless of criminal history.","Yes"
1,"I believe that this man should either be imprisoned or sent back to the authorities in his country of residence. He has a history of breaking the law continually and is a violent offender.","Yes"
0,"I think they should deport him for the first offence. If he comes back then he should be imprisoned.","No"
0,"This person is a citizen of another country. Perhaps he should be tried there.","No"
0,"Because he is breaking the law and people who break the law should go to jail.","Yes"
0,"The U.S.government should deport the man back to his home country and drop the charges against him. Although he was in the country illegally, he should not serve prison time because the prisons are overcrowded and we need to save room for real criminals. ","No"
1,"I don't think he should serve prison time since he already served time for previous crimes.  For entering the US illegally, the US government should just deport him.","No"
1,"I don't think the offender should be sent to prison just for the reason of being in the U.S. illegally, even though he was previously deported, because he has served his time for previous crimes. However, I think some action needs to be taken by the U.S. government. I think the offender should be placed on some probation period to ensure good behavior, and I also think there needs to be an option for a path to citizenship for this person, as long as he does not commit more violent crimes. I think that putting illegal immigrants in prison just for being an illegal immigrant is a poor use of funds for prisons.  ","No"
1,"I'm honestly not sure. It seems to me that he was deported and then re-entered the US illegally, but I can't quite tell if I'm reading the scenario correctly. On the one hand, he should just be deported (even though he broke the law); on the other hand, it seems that being deported does not stop him from coming back, so perhaps he should serve a jail sentence.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"Well obviously deportation does not work for this individual since he has already been and came back.  He is a repeat offender, one of these being a violent crime.  I feel that he should serve time in jail say a year or so and be deported again with the threat that if he is caught here again he will serve even more time.","Yes"
0,"he shouldn't go to prison in this country. he should be deported and returned to his country. entering the country illegally should result in deportation. its that simple.","No"
1,"I don't think this is something worth a prison sentence.  I would just deport him back to his country.","No"
0,"There should be some type of punishment, but I am not sure being put in prison would be the answer. That would just take further resources. I really don't know what should be done, it would depend on the other circumstances involved too.","Don‰Ûªt Know"
1,"He is a criminal and he needs to try and come to the county legally. He should be given that option, but coming to the country illegally is just another crime on top of his previous ones, so he should have to do it the legal way if he wants in.","Yes"
1,"He should go to prison based on prior offences. If he had not had priors, My opinion may have been different.","Yes"
0,"I don't think that coming here illegally constitutes prison time when there are other people already in the US who have done much worse things.","No"
0,"Coming from grandparents who were immigrants, the idea of freedom is what drives people to do insane things to get a taste of it. They're not bad people, they just want a better life. If the person had no previous convictions, I would say to send the person back to their country or at the very most, give them information of how to legally enter the country.","No"
